"It is brought in the writings of the Arizal that the generation of the future Geuloh is a gilgul (reincarnation) of the generation that came out of Egypt, and according to this, we are redeemed in the merit of the righteous women in our generation, for they themselves are the righteous women in whose merit we came out of Egypt."

## The Role of the Nosi Hador

"The completion and perfection of the avodah (spiritual mission) of the Nosi Hador (on his Yom Hahillula [day of his passing -- Yud Shevat]) is the completion and perfection of the avodah of the entire generation."

## Central Themes

The article discusses the concept of "disappearance" of righteous individuals upon completing their spiritual work, describing it as elevation to resurrection in the world-to-come rather than actual disappearance.

## Miriam Connection

The teaching connects to Miriam's role during the Egyptian exodus. The Midrash is cited: "Miriam is named for merirus [=bitterness]," noting that the hardest exile period began with her birth, yet "the Holy One, blessed be He, appointed the redeemer, this is Miriam."

## Contemporary Application

"We are assured that immediately the true and complete Geuloh is coming, and the women begin immediately (in the last moments of golus) to sing with tambourines and instruments, rejoicing over the coming of the true and complete Geuloh!"

The article concludes by describing righteous women expressing both yearning ("Ad mosai, ad mosai, ad mosai" meaning "until when?!") and joyful confidence in redemption's imminent arrival.
