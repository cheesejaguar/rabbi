1. When Jews gather together, there is tremendous unifying power. This effect strengthens when gatherings occur on the 12th of Tammuz because the Previous Rebbe's life centered on uniting Jews as one entity through Torah and mitzvos.

The Previous Rebbe devoted himself completely to this mission, placing his life at risk, which led to his imprisonment and eventual release on the 12th of Tammuz. Gratitude should be expressed to those who helped secure his freedom, including the United States government and its President.

Practically speaking, today's parallel involves millions of Jews behind the "Iron Curtain" forbidden to emigrate. Rather than public opposition, quiet diplomatic work proves most effective. Individual freedom to choose residence is universally acknowledged in international agreements, including those signed by Russia.

Those with influence bear personal obligation to use it. As the saying goes, "Who knows; perhaps you have reached royalty for such a time?" Time is critical, especially with recent leadership changes suggesting leniency. Success should come pleasantly and agreeably.

2. Every individual mirrors the entire world, reflecting the universe within themselves. Just as external "Iron Curtains" restrict Jews' freedom, internal spiritual barriers exist within each person.

According to Tanya, every Jew contains a yetzer tov (good inclination) and yetzer hora (evil inclination) in constant battle. The yetzer tov's divine nature cannot change, but when people follow the yetzer hora, they place their yetzer tov behind an "Iron Curtain," preventing full devotion to Torah and mitzvos.

Breaking this internal "Iron Curtain" liberates the yetzer tov and can transform the yetzer hora toward righteousness. Individual righteous action produces multiple effects: G-d grants blessings and success; others witness a living example of freedom; and world leaders become more receptive to proper advice. The 12th of Tammuz demonstrates how one individual can successfully oppose mighty forces.

3. Proper behavior worldwide requires implanting faith in the Creator within all inhabitants. This transcends specific religions -- merely acknowledging that the universe has a Source that constantly sustains existence.

Punishment threats fail because people think they can outsmart consequences. Only awareness of "the Eye that sees, and the Ear that hears" everything produces lasting behavioral change.

Ironically, public schools -- most crucial for forming responsible adults -- cannot mention the Creator, creating an "Iron Curtain" against such instruction. Yet legislative sessions begin with prayer, and currency bears "In G-d We Trust."

Historical examination reveals the Founding Fathers came to establish religious freedom, not prohibition. Even if constitutional restrictions existed, the Constitution itself allows amendment. Rising youth crime and societal deterioration justify revising the document. However, to prevent particular religious imposition, schools should institute "moments of silence" allowing children to contemplate the Creator.

4. Public protest must address physical attacks against Jews by certain groups -- specifically shaving beards and cutting peyos. Such actions, never perpetrated by Jews historically, resemble Nazi and Ammonite conduct.

Torah law states that those capable of bringing offenders to justice bear guilt if they remain silent. This principle applies especially here, given reasonable suspicion of further violence.

5. Everyone should commit to carefully fulfilling the daily Chitas portion (Chumash, Tehillim, Tanya) as established by the Previous Rebbe. Recent custom concludes with tzedakah, completing the three pillars sustaining the world: Torah (Chassidic discourse), tefillah (evening prayer), and tzedakah.
