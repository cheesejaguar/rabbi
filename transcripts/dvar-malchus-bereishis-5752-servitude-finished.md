## Opening Context

The Rambam states in his Laws of Kings that "Do not expect that in the Days of Moshiach the pattern of conduct of the world will change, but rather the world will conduct itself in a normal manner." The sages taught "there is no difference between this world and the world to come other than servitude to the nations."

## Core Teaching

The Rebbe explains that Jewish people were chosen by G-d and all Creation exists for their sake. Though appearing to be in "servitude to the nations" during exile, this doesn't reflect true subjugation.

"Even though the Jewish people in exile are found in a state of 'servitude to the nations'...the reason is not due to fear of the nations...but quite the contrary: Jews are the primary thing and the nations of the world were created for their sake."

"The command that 'the law of the land is the law' is not because he is in a state of servitude to the nations of the world, but because this is what Hashem decreed to be the state of affairs in exile."

## Deeper Meaning

According to Chassidic interpretation, "nations of the world" refers to natural human responses and emotions. Servitude means being bound by worldly perspectives despite knowing Torah's teachings. Freedom from servitude means recognizing Torah's instruction while no longer feeling compelled by natural inclinations -- maintaining the natural world's appearance while relating to it through Torah guidance.

## Example

A person facing financial hardship might naturally want to reduce charity and work on Shabbos to earn more. Freedom from servitude to nations means no longer feeling forced to compromise Torah principles for material concerns.

## Conclusion

"We still see a natural world, but we are now free to relate to that world in the way that Torah instructs -- without feeling compulsion from the nations of the world (from without or from within). This is the first stage of the Messianic Era."
