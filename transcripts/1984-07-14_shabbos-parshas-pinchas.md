1. Today is Shabbos, which is "sanctified of itself." But since the previous Rebbe instructed to hold farbrengens (not on every Shabbos but) on special Shabbosim, today's farbrengen is connected with the unique, special aspect of this Shabbos: It is the Shabbos which follows the 12th-13th of Tammuz, the days when the previous Rebbe was liberated from imprisonment.

The Shabbos following the 12th-13th of Tammuz is extra special this year, for the 12th-13th of Tammuz is Thursday and Friday, and therefore Shabbos follows them immediately, without any intervening weekdays.

The Shabbos which follows the 12th-13th of Tammuz would be special even if there were weekdays intervening, for Shabbos elevates all the days of the preceding week, including all aspects of the 12th-13th of Tammuz. The elevation produced by Shabbos works in two areas: It compensates for any omissions in service; it introduces greater perfection in that service. Further, this elevation produced by Shabbos is in the manner of "it is sanctified of itself," meaning the elevation comes from Above, to a degree that man's efforts cannot even reach.

This year, in which Shabbos immediately follows the 12th-13th of Tammuz, is special. Shabbos itself is connected with the idea of liberation, for a Jew is then free of weekday work. In this year, then, there are three consecutive days of liberation: the 12th of Tammuz, the 13th of Tammuz, and Shabbos -- which lends it the force of a "chazakah," since "a chazakah comes into being after three times."

Since "the body follows the head," all aspects of the liberation of the previous Rebbe ("the head") apply to and affect every Jew ("the body"), particularly those who follow in his steps.

When these days of liberation are utilized to ensure that service to G-d is performed in a manner of liberation, G-d, who pays "measure for measure," will bring the actual redemption.

2. We spoke above about the true and complete redemption. There are some, however, who question the whole matter. Why, they wonder, does this Jew incessantly speak publicly at every farbrengen about one subject -- the coming of our righteous Mashiach. He repeats the previous Rebbe's call, "Forthwith to the redemption!" and emphasizes that this is not just words, but means the actual coming of Mashiach, immediately -- today, Shabbos parshas Pinchas, 5744!

Every Jew believes, of course, that Mashiach can come at any moment, as written: "I will wait for him every day that he may come." Yet, these people wonder, why is it necessary to speak about it incessantly, to emphasize constantly that Mashiach can come at this very moment?

Such thoughts as these people have do not stem from lack of faith, G-d forbid, for every Jew believes that Mashiach can come at any moment. But the knowledge that we are still in exile, and that the exodus from exile is possible only with G-d's desire, has caused the exile to so permeate a person's senses that his faith in the redemption is but external and superficial, and talk of the redemption appears to him to be as a dream.

The truth is the exact opposite. The Alter Rebbe (Torah Or, parshas Vayeishev, p 28c) explains that exile is the dream, for the true place of a Jew, his true being, is the redemption, whereas exile is a foreign matter. Thus exile is a dream and the redemption is reality.

The Alter Rebbe explains further that in a dream two opposites can co-exist. In exile, too, a person can synthesize two opposites: He can be engaged in business the whole day, and simultaneously arouse his love to G-d in prayer, and cleave to G-d.

The Alter Rebbe is explaining the good aspect of the dream of exile. Although one may be steeped in worldly matters, he can nevertheless totally change in one moment, and shaking free from the illusions of the world, arrive at the true reality: love of and cleaving to G-d. A Jew can do this for in a dream, two opposites can co-exist.

Our case is similar: Because exile is a dream, in which opposites can co-exist, the situation can change in a moment: Jews can leave the dream of exile and enter reality -- the redemption.

Every single Jew holds the key to the redemption, as the Alter Rebbe writes: "It is stated in Tikkunim that if even one tzaddik [and 'Your people are all tzaddikim'] in a generation returns in complete repentance, Mashiach would come immediately." And Rambam rules, "When a person does a mitzvah, he tilts himself and the whole world to the meritorious side, and brings redemption and salvation for himself and for them." And, as noted above, this can be achieved in a moment.

Moreover, the previous Rebbe has already announced "Forthwith to redemption!" and informed us that the situation is one of "Behold, he [Mashiach] is standing behind our wall, he looks in at the windows, he peers through the lattice." Mashiach is waiting, looking -- and Mashiach's looking certainly has an effect.

May it be G-d's will that our talking and importuning so much about the coming of our righteous Mashiach will so disturb and vex G-d that He will have no choice (so to speak) but to bring the redemption. This is particularly so since G-d Himself mightily wants the redemption, for since the Divine Presence was exiled together with the Jews, the redemption of the Jews means also G-d's redemption!

3. We spoke above about the fact that this Shabbos follows the 12th-13th of Tammuz. In addition, there is a lesson to be derived from today's date, the fourteenth of Tammuz.

The fourth chapter of Megillas Taanis relates the following: "On the fourteenth of Tammuz the Book of Laws was abolished." This refers to the Book of Laws of the Tzeddukim (Sadducees -- those who did not believe in the Oral Law). Because they believed the Written Law could be understood without the interpretations of the Oral Law, they possessed a "Book of Laws" which stated the laws of the Written Torah as they understood them.

There is a connection between this event which took place on the fourteenth of Tammuz and the days of liberation on the 12th-13th of Tammuz. The "Book of Laws" of the Tzeddukim is the evil equivalent of the Books of Halachah, such as the Six Orders of the Mishneh and Rambam's Mishneh Torah. Thus the abolition of the Tzeddukim's Book of Laws means an increase in the study of the Torah's halachos.

What is the connection to the idea of redemption? The Alter Rebbe explains that the verse "Tzion shall be redeemed with justice" refers to the study of halachos, through which we merit the redemption.

4. Parshas Pinchas talks of the different sacrifices offered throughout the year -- the daily sacrifices, Shabbos sacrifices, and festival sacrifices. Chapter 28, verse 2, states: "Command the children of Israel, and say to them: My offering, My food-offering consumed by fire, a pleasing odor to Me, you shall be careful to offer Me at its appointed time." Rashi, quoting the words "at its appointed time," comments: "Every day is the appointed time of the daily offerings."

This verse is referring to the daily offering which was brought twice a day, every day -- once in the morning and once toward evening. Rashi interprets the "appointed time" in this verse to mean every day -- for "every day is the appointed time of the daily offering."

But Rashi's interpretation poses a question. We find a previous instance when the term "at its appointed time" is used concerning the Pesach sacrifice. There, Rashi interprets it to mean the offering overrides Shabbos and the state of uncleanliness. He should have offered the same interpretation here.

The explanation is that concerning the Pesach offering, "at its appointed time" is superfluous, and therefore Rashi explains it teaches that the offering overrides Shabbos and uncleanliness. In our parshah, the difficulty is that this term seems inappropriate for an offering brought every day. Rashi therefore explains that Scripture is teaching us a novel interpretation: that "every day is the appointed time of the daily offerings." There is now no room for another interpretation since this term is no longer superfluous.

5. In today's portion of Rambam, we conclude the Laws of Marriage. The last law (25:13) concerns a woman whose husband had an offensive defect and dies childless, and she is bound to his brother who has the same defect. She may say, "I was able to endure your brother but I cannot endure you," and the brother performs the chalitzah ceremony.

Rambam then concludes with the verse: "And you shall see your children's children, and peace upon Israel." This verse alludes to the court's duty to first try to persuade the woman to accept the brother as her husband. Rambam does not write this law explicitly but only alludes to it by citing this verse, for this law is not cited anywhere in the Talmud or the Geonim.
