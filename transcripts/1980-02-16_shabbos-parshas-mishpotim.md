**Occasion:** Shabbos Parshas Mishpotim, Mevorchim Chodesh Adar
**Source:** Sichos In English, Volume 5

---

## Four Significant Aspects

The Rebbe identifies four factors making this Shabbos particularly meaningful:

1. **Shabbos Parshas Mishpotim** -- Following the Alter Rebbe's principle to "live with the times" by applying Torah portions to contemporary life

2. **Shabbos Mevarchim Chodesh Adar** -- The Shabbos designated for blessing the approaching month

3. **Machor Chodesh** -- The eve of the new month, intensifying connection to Adar's arrival

4. **Shabbos Parshas Shekalim** -- Special Torah reading about the half-shekel contributions to Temple offerings

These factors collectively relate to the Yahrzeit (anniversary of passing) of the Previous Rebbe on the 10th of Shvat.

## Connection to Four Talmudic Tractates

The Rebbe draws parallels between these four aspects and four Talmudic tractates that conclude with identical statements about Torah scholars increasing peace: Berachos, Kerisus, Nazir, and Yevamos.

## The Service of Machor Chodesh

A central teaching addresses the concept of Machor Chodesh and its spiritual implications:

The moon's concealment on Erev Rosh Chodesh represents self-annulment (Bittul) and subjugation of negativity (Iscafia). However, this service isn't an end itself but rather preparation for transformation (Ishopchah) -- converting darkness into revelation of G-dliness.

## Practical Application

The Rebbe emphasizes that even contemplative individuals devoted to Torah study bear responsibility to actively influence others toward righteous living. Humility and self-effacement must eventually manifest as constructive outreach to elevate the world spiritually.

The teaching specifically states: "Now is the time when our service must be in a manner of 'Grab and eat, Grab and drink'" -- seizing every opportunity to spread holiness.

## Historical Context

This sicho references the Previous Rebbe's redemption from Soviet imprisonment and emphasizes how his legacy of spreading Torah and Chassidus worldwide continues affecting all Jewish people, particularly after the thirtieth anniversary of his passing.

## Conclusion

The central message combines introspection with action, suggesting that spiritual self-refinement ultimately serves the greater purpose of transforming the world through Torah and Mitzvos.
