# Vayishlach - Empowerment And Its Purpose

**Source:** In The Garden Of The Torah, Sichos In English

The essay emphasizes that the Torah reading's name describes its central theme: "every person is selected by G-d as a shliach (an agent) to do his part in the task to make this world a dwelling for G-d."

## The Principal-Agent Relationship

The teaching presents three rabbinic conceptions of the principal-agent relationship:

1. The agent bears responsibility for actions, while the principal bears consequences
2. The agent remains independent, yet deeds are attributed to the principal
3. "A person's agent is considered as the person himself" -- the agent functions as an extension of the principal

Two concepts unite all approaches: empowerment depends on the principal's authorization, and agents must use their own initiative and intellect.

## Divine Service Application

Every person serves as G-d's agent, responsible for revealing that "the world is G-d's dwelling." Individuals must balance recognizing themselves as mere agents while actively applying Torah principles using personal initiative.

## Three Levels of Commitment

The teaching describes varying spiritual levels: righteous individuals permeated with G-dliness; those performing mitzvos selflessly; and even those performing commandments without conscious G-dly awareness -- all contribute to transforming the world.

## The Mission's Scope

The message encompasses refining material dimensions and inspiring others: "One shliach makes another." This collective effort toward universal "knowledge of G-d" precipitates messianic redemption.
