# Vayikra - The Dearness of Every Jew

## Within the Many - One

Jewish people display remarkable diversity across countries and civilizations throughout history. Yet this heterogeneity masks a fundamental unity. The Sages teach that "just as the faces of no two people are alike, so too, their thought processes differ." However, every Jew possesses a soul that is "an actual part of G-d," permeating all dimensions of existence.

G-d declares regarding this nation: "I created this nation for Myself, they will recite My praise." Each Jew inherits the spiritual heritage extending back through generations to the patriarchs and matriarchs. Every individual represents the entire collective throughout history. Consequently, G-d cherishes each Jew as a father holds dear an only son.

## Closeness with G-d

The Torah opening reflects this divine affection: "And He called to Moshe, and G-d spoke to him." G-d's call preceded His speech, demonstrating unique endearment. This call expressed the fundamental bond of love connecting the Divine with our people, not merely transmitting information.

The inner G-dly nature within us actively seeks expression. The Torah reading's subject -- sacrificial offerings -- illustrates this principle. The Hebrew word "korban" (sacrifice) shares a root with "kerev" (closeness). Sacrifices bring spiritual potential to the surface, drawing people and individuals near to G-d.

## Loving Outreach

These concepts transcend abstract philosophy, directly affecting how we relate to fellow Jews, including those currently distant from Torah heritage. We must recognize who others truly are: beings whose souls are "an actual part of G-d."

Rather than emphasizing negative conduct, highlight inner potential and the G-dly spark within. Emulate the Torah reading's example by showing fellow Jews special closeness and inviting them toward expressions of their G-dly core. Pursue this approach confidently, recognizing it addresses our people's fundamental essence: "No Jew can -- or desires to -- separate himself from G-d."

## Seek the Silver Lining

A natural impulse urges immediate achievement of complete Torah observance while criticizing delay -- an improper approach. When Prophet Yeshayahu made harsh statements about the Jewish people, though justified, G-d rebuked him severely.

Instead, appreciate and accentuate the positive qualities every Jew possesses. Independent of any divine service performed, each Jew's existence expresses G-d's praise. In this generation, every Jew -- regardless of Jewish identification -- represents a living miracle expressing Divine praise.

Despite being "one lamb among seventy wolves" facing severe persecution, the Jewish people endured while mightier nations disappeared, demonstrating G-d's invested eternality. This particularly applies today, barely a generation after the Holocaust's devastation. Our people's survival and new generations' birth reveal G-d's providential hand operating in our world.

## The Ultimate Praise

The G-dly potential within each Jew and our entire people will not remain dormant. Its flowering will usher in the era when G-dliness latent throughout creation becomes manifest -- the Redemption.

Then the Jewish people will fully "relate G-d's praise," expressing gratitude for performed miracles. This connects to Nissan's timing, the month when Parshas Vayikra typically occurs. Our Sages associate Nissan with wondrous miracles and call it "the month of redemption" -- when Jews were redeemed and will be redeemed in the future.

Then the entire Jewish people -- men, women, and children -- will proceed to the Holy Land and "relate G-d's praise" in the Beis HaMikdash. May this occur soon.
