## Confronting Challenge

On one hand, people shy away from challenges. There is a danger of failure -- were there not, it would not be a challenge -- and no one appreciates a brush with failure. On the other hand, we seek challenge, for confronting a challenge taps our inner resources, lifting us out of the mundane doldrums of ordinary experience.

Similar concepts apply with regard to our divine service. G-d does not want our divine service to be in the doldrums. And so, He presents us with challenges. Some of these challenges are limited in scope, and some are deeper, forcing us to summon up our deepest resources of commitment.

This is the nature of the challenge of exile. During the Era of the Beis HaMikdash, the open revelation of G-dliness inspired the Jews to serve G-d with heightened feeling and deep intent. In the era of exile, by contrast, G-dliness is hidden, and we are presented with many different hurdles in our observance of the Torah and its mitzvos. We can no longer rely on our external environment to motivate deeper understanding and feeling for G-dliness. Instead, our focus must become internal; the challenges of exile arouse our deepest resources of soul, and elevate our connection to G-d to a higher level.

## The Paradox of Exile

These concepts are reflected in our Torah reading which describes the successive descents experienced by the Jewish people in Egypt. Even after Moshe returned with the promise of redemption, the oppression of the Jewish people grew to the extent that Moshe himself cried out: "Since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people."

Nevertheless, coupled with these difficulties, the Torah reading also relates how the Jews cried out to G-d, awakening His attention. In response, G-d conveyed the promise of Redemption and His pledge that, "when you take this people out of Egypt, you will serve G-d on this mountain," i.e., G-d committed Himself to give the Jews the Torah. This opened the possibility for a higher and deeper bond with G-d than could have possibly been reached before.

## The Story a Name Tells

These two polarities are reflected in the name of the Torah reading Shmos, which means "names." There are two dimensions to a person's name. On one hand, a name represents the external aspects of a person's being. Nevertheless, as the Alter Rebbe writes in Tanya, a name represents an entity's nature and life-force. It is the channel that allows that inner nature to be expressed.

To relate these points to the concepts of exile and redemption: As long as what is revealed is merely the external dimension of the Jews' name, it is possible for the Jews to be subjugated to worldly powers. But when the essence of the Jews' name, Yisrael, is expressed there is no potential for exile. For the name Yisrael indicates how "you contended with G-d and with men and prevailed."

This points to the fundamental difference between exile and redemption. For exile does not represent a change in the essence of our relationship with G-d. What is the difference between exile and redemption? Whether "our name is being called" and we are responding, i.e., whether this relationship is openly expressed or concealed, and remaining merely as a potential.

## Destiny and Direction

The cycle of exile and redemption is not a coincidental circumstance, but a Divinely ordained process. G-d desired that the Jews reach higher peaks of divine service, and so He structured a setting, the challenges of exile, which would compel them to express their deepest spiritual potentials. And at the outset, He gave them the potential to overcome these challenges.

## From Exile to Redemption

The cycle of exile and redemption is significant, not only for Jewish people, but for the world at large. The purpose of creation is to establish a dwelling for G-d. This dwelling is fashioned by the Jewish people who involve themselves in different aspects of worldly experience and reveal the G-dliness enclothed in these elements of existence. During the exile, the Jews are scattered in different lands and brought into contact with diverse types of encounters. As the challenge of exile lifts the Jews to a deeper level of connection to G-d, it also elevates the surroundings in which their service is carried out, making manifest the G-dliness which permeates our world as a whole.

The saga of exile and redemption is not merely a story of the past. On the contrary, at present the concept is most relevant, for this is the essence of the transition whose ripples are affecting all dimensions of existence at present. To borrow an expression from the Previous Rebbe, "Everything is ready for the Redemption; even the buttons have been polished."

All that is necessary is a change of focus, that we open our eyes, see Mashiach's influence, and create a setting for it to encompass mankind as a whole.
