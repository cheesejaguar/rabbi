## What the Background Says

In the art of communication, the choice of a setting in which to convey a message is very important. Indeed, the setting itself imparts a significant portion of the message. Similar concepts apply with regard to G-d's choice of a location for the giving of the Torah.

Our Sages ask: "Why was the Torah given in the desert?" G-d was not compelled to give the Torah in any given place. As such, His choice of location was purposeful, and can provide us with insights.

This significance, moreover, is relevant, not only for the Jews who received the Torah at Sinai, but for man in every generation. For we praise G-d as Nosain HaTorah, "the Giver of the Torah," using the present tense.

## Where No Ownership Exists

The first of the explanations given by our Sages is that a desert is an ownerless place; it does not belong to anyone individually. The same holds true for the Torah. It is not the exclusive possession of any particular individual, tribe, or type of personality. On the contrary, "The crown of the Torah is set aside, waiting, and ready for every Jew.... Whoever desires, may come and take it."

The ownerless nature of the desert also provides a key to understanding how a person can take possession of the Torah. As our Sages continue, a person must "make himself like a desert, relinquishing all concerns" i.e., he must let loose all the constraints which hold back his commitment to the Torah.

The Torah is G-d's will and His wisdom, and is thus infinite and unbounded as He is Himself. Therefore approaching the Torah requires a person to step above himself and accept a different framework of understanding.

This was reflected in our ancestors' pledge: Naaseh VeNishmah, "We will do and we will listen." The order of the promises they made is significant. Instead of first listening to G-d's commandments and then deciding whether to accept them or not, they showed no hesitation and promised to obey Him regardless of what would be entailed. Rather than have their understanding shape their commitment, they promised to have their commitment shape their understanding.

## A Declaration of Dependence

When a person makes such a commitment, G-d molds his environment to enable him to express it. In the desert, our ancestors had to depend on G-d for every element of their existence. There was no natural means on which they could rely. Nevertheless, this was not a cause of anxiety or worry. On the contrary, despite the barrenness and desolation of the desert, our ancestors entered it with loving trust, as the prophet declares, "I have remembered for you the kindness of your youth, the love of your bridal days, your following after Me in the desert, in an uncultivated land."

And G-d responded with loving care. Their food, their water, even their clothing, were all granted to them miraculously. G-d cared for everything they needed, giving them the opportunity to devote themselves solely to the Torah.

Even though seemingly we have natural means of deriving our livelihood, the truth is that nature itself is a series of miracles. This awareness should motivate an obvious ordering of our priorities. Instead of giving primacy to our material concerns, we should give precedence to the Torah. When we do so, we can be confident that G-d will provide us with our needs as He provided for our ancestors.

## For the Desert to Bloom

The barrenness of the desert can also serve as an analogy for a person's spiritual state. Although a person feels empty and desolate -- and perhaps with good reason, for he has been living in a spiritual desert -- there is no need for despair. The Torah was given in the desert. G-d descended into the wilderness and gave man His most precious possession, the Torah. And the same is true today, regardless of a person's spiritual level, G-d extends Himself to him and offers him the opportunity of establishing a connection through the medium of the Torah.

Encouraging that we emulate this initiative, our Sages urge us to "be the students of Aharon,... loving the created beings and bringing them close to the Torah." In Tanya, the Alter Rebbe explains that this statement teaches that we must reach out and love every Jew, even one who is barren like a desert, and whose only redeeming characteristic is that he is G-d's creation.

Our Sages relate that during the Jewish people's forty years of wandering, they were able to transform the desert into "settled land" to the point where trees flowered and gave fruit. Our study of Torah can produce a similar effect. The aspects of ourselves and of others that appear barren can become productive through the influence of Torah.

## The Ultimate Flowering

Parshas Bamidbar, "In the desert," is always read before the holiday of Shavuos. The Jewish holidays do not merely commemorate the events of the past, they also provide us with an opportunity to relive them. To prepare to relive the Sinai experience, we have to pass through -- at least in a spiritual sense -- the desert and its lessons.

In particular, these lessons are relevant at present, for our generation is awaiting a new phase in the revelation of the Torah, the era when "new [dimensions of the] Torah will emerge from Me." The giving of the Torah will never be repeated. Nevertheless, our Sages have said that the Torah teachings of the present age are "as nothing compared to the teachings of Mashiach." For in that era, the G-dly dimension of the Torah will be openly revealed, and everyone will be able to appreciate its spiritual message.

Just as the Jews eagerly underwent the preparations for the revelations at Mount Sinai, anxiously counting the days until they would receive the Torah, we too should prepare for the revelation of Mashiach's teachings with excitement and joy. And then "the pastures of the desert will sprout, and the tree will give its fruit," with the coming of the Redemption. May it be in the immediate future.
