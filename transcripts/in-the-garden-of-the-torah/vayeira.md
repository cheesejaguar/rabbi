## A Child's Tears

When Rabbi Sholem Dov Ber, the fifth Rebbe of Lubavitch, was four or five years old, he was taken to his grandfather the Tzemach Tzedek, for a birthday blessing. When he entered his grandfather's room, he began to cry. After calming him, his grandfather asked him the reason for his tears. The child replied, "In cheder, we learned that G-d revealed Himself to Avraham. Why doesn't He reveal Himself to me?"

The Tzemach Tzedek replied, "When a Jew who is ninety-nine years old recognizes that he must circumcise himself, he deserves that G-d reveal Himself to him."

## Redefining Landmarks

The Zohar also highlights Avraham's circumcision as a turning point in the nature of the Divine revelations he received. When describing the revelations Avraham was granted before the circumcision, the Torah states, "And G-d appeared to him in a vision," using the Aramaic term "machezeh" for the word vision. In contrast, Parshas Vayera begins "And G-d appeared to him," using a Hebrew term "vayera" which implies a direct revelation.

Hebrew is Lashon HaKodesh, "the holy tongue," the language which G-d employs to express Himself. Other languages, by contrast, are human inventions. By using an Aramaic term, the Torah implies that the revelations Avraham experienced before circumcision were clothed in the material trappings of our world. He could conceive of G-d only in human terms; he could not appreciate Him as He truly is.

The act of circumcision transformed the nature of Avraham's being, enabling him to perceive G-d as He is. Therefore the revelation of Vayeira was direct, without any veils or constraints. G-d manifested Himself for Avraham openly; this spanned the gap separating a created being from its Creator.

## Man's Striving; G-d's Response

Parshas Lech Lecha describes Avraham's striving to go beyond the limits of mortal existence and develop a complete bond with G-d. The culmination of this spiritual journey was his circumcision, which established a bond with G-d in his actual flesh.

Parshas Vayeira, by contrast, represents a different mode of conduct. The direct revelation of G-dliness remade Avraham's nature. As he existed within a material body and functioned within his worldly environment, he was able to share a complete and all-encompassing bond with G-d.

Avraham left this heritage to his descendants, for the deeds of the forefathers serve as a sign to their children. Every person has the potential to transcend his individual nature and to enter into a limitless bond with G-d through his observance of the Torah and its mitzvos.

## Sickness and Healing

The revelation of Parshas Vayeira is associated with healing. Avraham was suffering from the pain of the circumcision. G-d came to "visit the sick," and with that visit, healed Avraham.

The Hebrew word "chole" meaning "afflicted by sickness," is numerically equivalent to 49. Our Sages speak of "50 gates of understanding" which grant man knowledge of G-d. Within the scope of mortal knowledge, it is possible to "enter" only 49 of these gates. The fiftieth level is by definition above our limited grasp.

A person who has attained the forty-ninth level appreciates his inadequacy and wants to rise above it. And the fact that the very nature of his humanity prevents him from doing so makes him sick, pained with a yearning for a complete bond with G-d. To this sickness, King Solomon alluded with his allegory, "Support me with the stout trunks; let me rest among the apple trees, for I am lovesick."

This sickness is healed through the consummate revelation of Vayeira. The direct manifestation of G-d fulfills this yearning, and remakes the person's nature, allowing him to realize his innate G-dly essence, and function above his mortal limitations.

## With the Heart of a Child

Since the desire for a direct bond with G-d is a fundamental element of a person's makeup, when the Rebbe Rashab came to his grandfather for a birthday blessing, he expressed this longing.

The truth this story points to is not merely individual in nature. Within every one of us there is a childlike dimension that enables us to relate to G-d with youthful simplicity and single-mindedness. Without ceasing to function with mature responsibility, each of us can share an all-encompassing relationship with G-d.

The above is particularly relevant in the present age, brief moments before Mashiach's coming. For the essence of the Era of the Redemption will be the direct revelation of G-d; "Your Master will conceal Himself no longer, and your eyes will perceive your Master."

## Measure for Measure

The Torah tells us that G-d appeared to Avraham while "sitting at the entrance of his tent, in the heat of the day." Why was he sitting there? To look for guests. Avraham dedicated himself to deeds of kindness, feeding hungry wayfarers in an effort to heighten their awareness of G-d. Because he extended himself to bring others closer to G-d, G-d showed him a supreme expression of closeness.

"Days are coming..., [when people will be] hungry -- but not for bread, thirsty -- but not for water, but to hear the word of G-d." At times, this thirst is consciously felt, and in other instances, a person may be unaware of his own thirst. Nevertheless, when we emulate Avraham's example and extend ourselves to these individuals, we will discover a readiness to respond that reflects their inner nature.

And as in the example of Avraham, these outreach efforts will benefit not only the recipients, but also those who give, precipitating a deeper and more inclusive connection to G-dliness. And this connection will continue to grow and blossom until it reaches consummate perfection in the Era of the Redemption; may this take place in the immediate future.
