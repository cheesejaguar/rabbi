## A Lasting Legacy

All of us desire posterity. We want our lives to bring something lasting into the world. This is the message of Parshas Toldos: that a person can leave a legacy that will continue to thrive after his passing.

Our Rabbis offer two definitions of the word Toldos:

1. progeny -- this includes both a person's biological children and also his "spiritual children," i.e., the individuals whom he has taught. Both of these types of children perpetuate the person's influence.

2. the chronicles of one's life and experiences. When a person's life is full of inner meaning, the chronicles of his life continue to provide depth and inspiration for people in coming generations.

## A Fountain of Inner Strength

With whom does the Torah choose to associate the message of Toldos? Yitzchak. There are two particulars which reflect the nature of Yitzchak's divine service:

1. unlike his father Avraham, he never left Eretz Yisrael,
2. his efforts were focused on digging wells.

Through his journeys, Avraham spread G-dliness in the lands in which he sojourned. Yitzchak, by contrast, never traveled outside the Holy Land and even within Eretz Yisrael, we do not find many stories of his efforts to reach out to others. His divine service had, instead, an inward focus.

This is reflected in his efforts to dig wells. Digging a well involves removing the layers of earth and uncovering the source of life-giving water that is found in one's own place. In the analogue, this refers to the efforts to penetrate to one's G-dly core and activate it as a source of inner strength.

Each of us has a neshamah which is "an actual part of G-d" and every entity in the world is maintained by a G-dly spark. Yitzchak's thrust involved realizing these inner potentials, bringing them to the surface, and using them to initiate positive change.

In this manner, the awareness of G-d becomes an integral part of one's life. It does not remain merely an external factor, dependent on the teachings of others, but, instead, comes from one's own insight, and is internalized within one's own thinking processes.

## Inwardness Which Leads Outward

One might, however, ask: This is surely a worthy path of divine service, but why is it associated with the name Toldos which means "progeny"?

By naming this Torah reading Toldos, our Rabbis underscore the fact that the inwardness of Yitzchak also produces "progeny." Yitzchak's divine service and the positive influence it generates attracts the attention of others and motivates them to seek a bond with him and follow his guidance.

In this vein, our Torah reading relates that Avimelech, the king of the Philistines, and Phichol, his general, came to visit Yitzchak and told him, "We have seen that G-d is with you." Yitzchak's divine service was able to bring them to a recognition of G-d's active presence within the world.

Indeed, in contrast to the awareness generated by Avraham's efforts, the awareness Yitzchak inspired was more permanent and lasting, for it came from the people themselves.

## To Communicate to Our Children

In the most complete sense, our desire for posterity is focused on our children. We want them to continue and further the principles and values of our homes. And here a difficulty arises: Yitzchak's children were Esav and Yaakov.

Although openly Esav's conduct did not demonstrate that he was Yitzchak's son, the connection between them, nevertheless, existed. This is reflected by our Sages' statement that Esav's head was buried "in the bosom of Yitzchak his father." Similarly, our Sages explain that, in contrast to Yishmael who is not considered as an heir of Avraham, Esav is considered as Yitzchak's heir. For the source of Esav's soul, his head, contained very powerful divine sparks, and these were associated with Yitzchak.

The ultimate consummation of the efforts to reveal Esav's spiritual potential will be in the Era of the Redemption when "Deliverers will go up to Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esav, and the sovereignty will be G-d's."

## A Source of Light for All Mankind

Our Sages relate that in the Era of the Redemption, the Jews will praise Yitzchak, telling him: "You are our Patriarch." For in that era, the inward thrust of Yitzchak will permeate all existence. "The occupation of the entire world will be solely to know G-d. The Jews will be great sages and will know the hidden matters, attaining an understanding of their Creator to the [full] extent of mortal potential."

Although all the Jews will all live in Eretz Yisrael, they will -- as their ancestor Yitzchak -- influence mankind as a whole. "And it shall come to pass in the end of days that the mountain of G-d's house will be established on the top of the mountains... and all the nations shall flow unto it. Many people shall say, 'Come let us ascend the mountain of G-d... and He will teach us of His ways.'"

The divine service of the Jews and the influence it will arouse will radiate to the world at large, motivating them to seek G-dly knowledge. May this take place in the immediate future.
