# Balak - Remembering What Should Be Forgotten

## A Sage and His Conduct

The Talmud relates: When Ulla came [to Babylon from Eretz Yisrael],... Rava asked him: "Where did you spend the night?" [Ulla] told him: "In Kalnebo." [Rava] responded: "Is it not written: 'And you may not mention the name of other deities'?" [Ulla] answered: "Rabbi Yochanan taught as follows: [The name of] any false deity which is recorded in the Torah may be mentioned."

On the surface, the question arises: Although it is permitted to mention the name of a false deity which is recorded in the Torah, seemingly, it is not desirable to do so. What purpose could this serve? Moreover, our Sages emphasize the importance of refined speech, noting how in several instances, the Torah adds extra words rather than mention the word tameh ("impure"). Surely, Ulla could have found a way to answer Rava's question without mentioning the name of a false deity.

## The Power of the Torah

The above difficulty can be resolved based on the explanation of Rabbi Yochanan's teaching offered by the Yereim: "Since the Torah mentions [the name of a false deity], it has already been negated. For the same reason that the Torah mentions it, we are entitled to mention it."

The intent appears to be that the Torah's mention of the false deity negates the deity's importance in the eyes of a person who would study that portion of the Torah. The Torah's words will impress him with the futility of the worship of all other deities -- that these deities are of no benefit to those who revere them, and that when the Jews have erred and worshipped them, they were punished severely.

Going further, every Jew desires to observe the Torah and its mitzvos and therefore to shun the worship of false deities. And when he studies the Torah, this awakens this inner desire, inspiring him to dedicate himself to the Torah and negate all other forms of worship.

"For the same reason that the Torah mentions [a false deity], we are entitled to mention it." When a Jew studies the Torah and identifies with it, he taps the G-dly potential it contains. This empowers him, and enables his mention of a false deity to bring about the negation of its influence.

## A Spiritual Transition

Based on the above, we can understand the conduct of Ulla. Our Sages state: "A Jew living in the Diaspora serves false divinities in purity." For in Eretz Yisrael, G-d's providence is more overtly revealed, while in the Diaspora, Divine influence is hidden with the natural order. As such, just as in a literal sense, the worship of false divinities involves bowing one's head to them, so too, figuratively, when living in the Diaspora, one is required to subjugate one's thinking process to the forces controlling the natural order.

Upon leaving the holiness of Eretz Yisrael and entering Babylonia, Ulla sensed the transition in spiritual sensitivity, and felt it necessary to emphasize the negation of false deities. Therefore summoning up the power of the Torah acquired through his study in Eretz Yisrael, he mentioned the name of a false deity with the intent of nullifying its influence.

## Nullifying and Transforming

The above discussion sheds light on an obvious question raised by the name of this week's Torah reading: Balak. Balak was a wicked man, an immoral king, who hated the Jewish people and wanted to destroy them. Why then is his name immortalized as one of the weekly Torah readings?

Based on the above, however, the intent is clear. Naming the Torah reading Balak is a means of negating the forces associated with him. As the Torah reading relates, Balak's intent was thwarted entirely. In a similar manner, the name Parshas Balak is an eternal source of positive influence frustrating any and all powers that seek to harm the Jewish people.

The narrative in our Torah reading relates, moreover, not only that Balak's intent was foiled, but that Bilaam whom Balak brought to curse the Jewish people showered powerful blessings upon them, including the ultimate blessings which will become manifest with the coming of Mashiach. Thus the name Balak refers, not only to the negation of evil, but also its transformation into positive influence.

## The Fruits of Unbounded Commitment

During several years, Parshas Balak is read together with Parshas Chukas. For it is the selfless commitment implied by the name Chukas which makes possible the transformation of evil into good alluded to in the name Balak.

When a person taps the spark of G-dliness within his soul and expresses it through unbounded devotion to the Torah, he influences his surrounding environment, negating undesirable influences and transforming them into good.

As this pattern spreads throughout existence, we draw closer to the fulfillment of the prophecies mentioned in this week's Torah reading: "A star shall emerge from Yaakov, and a staff shall arise in Israel, crushing all of Moab's princes, and dominating all of Seth's descendants." May they be fully manifest in the immediate future.
