# Tetzaveh - A Paradigm Of Leadership

## A Leader's Commitment

Leadership involves self-sacrifice. Everyone understands that to receive you have to give, but true leadership is above this type of barter. A genuine leader rises above self-concern entirely. He identifies totally with his people and their purpose and is willing to give up everything he has for them.

Moshe Rabbeinu epitomized this type of leadership. When G-d told him that He would destroy the Jewish people because of the sin of the Golden Calf, Moshe responded: "If You would, forgive their sin. And if not, please obliterate me from the book You have written."

By making this statement, Moshe offered to sacrifice more than his life; he was also giving up everything that he stood for. "The book You have written" refers to "the entire Torah." Moshe was identified with Torah. "He dedicated his soul for it." Nevertheless, he was willing to sacrifice his connection with the Torah for the Jewish people.

Why? Because Moshe is one with the Jewish people. "Moshe is Israel, and Israel is Moshe." However deep his connection was with the Torah, Moshe's connection with the Jewish people was deeper, touching the very essence of his being.

This bond connects Moshe to every single Jew, regardless of his level of divine service. For whom was Moshe willing to sacrifice everything? For the Jews who had worshipped the Golden Calf. Regardless of what they had done, Moshe's commitment to them remained unchanged. Since the connection he shared with them stemmed from the essence of his being -- and touched the essence of their being, their conduct, however far removed from the spirit of Moshe's teachings, could not sever the bond between them.

## Three Prototypes of Righteous Conduct

Our Sages compare three righteous men: Noach, Avraham, and Moshe.

Noach was himself totally righteous, but he showed little concern for the people around him. He spent 120 years building the ark to arouse the people's curiosity, and would tell them of the need to repent if they asked. But nothing more. He did not seek to influence his neighbors to change their conduct, nor did he pray to G-d to avert the coming of the flood.

Avraham, by contrast, sought to improve the people among whom he lived. On the verse, "He proclaimed there the name of G-d, eternal L-rd," our Sages comment, "Do not read vayikra -- 'he proclaimed,' but vayakri -- 'he made others proclaim.'" Avraham would publicize G-d's presence and motivate others to call on Him. Moreover, when G-d told Avraham that He was going to destroy the city of Sodom, Avraham prayed for the people, challenging G-d: "Will You wipe out the righteous and the wicked? ... It would be sacrilege for You ... to kill the righteous with the wicked ... Shall not the whole world's Judge act justly?"

Moshe, however, showed a more encompassing commitment. Avraham's prayer was for "the righteous." Moshe, by contrast, prayed for the Jews who had worshipped the Golden Calf. As leader of his people, his commitment extended to every Jew, even those whose conduct stood in direct opposition to his own values. It was for the sake of these people, Moshe told G-d: "If not, please obliterate me from the book."

## Deeper than a Name

Our Sages state: "A curse given by a wise man, even when conditional, becomes manifest." On that basis, our Rabbis explain that even though G-d accepted Moshe's prayer for the Jews, the malediction he pronounced on himself had an effect. Moshe's name is mentioned in every Torah reading from Parshas Shmos which describes his birth, until the book of Deuteronomy, which conveys his farewell addresses with one exception: Parshas Tetzaveh. In this reading, Moshe's name was -- in keeping with his request -- stricken out.

This does not, however, mean that Moshe is not associated with Parshas Tetzaveh. On the contrary, a name reflects merely the dimension of a person which relates to others. The essence of a person's being, who he really is, is above his name. Parshas Tetzaveh does not mention Moshe's name, for it communicates the aspect of his being which cannot be expressed in a name.

Moshe's self-sacrifice for the Jewish people stemmed from the essence of his being. It is this fundamental dimension which Parshas Tetzaveh brings to our attention.

## Interrelated Bonds

These concepts are reflected in the opening phrase of the Torah reading: VeAtah tetzaveh es bnai Yisrael, "And you shall command the children of Israel." Tetzaveh translated as "command" relates to the word tzavsa which means "connection." The verse is a charge for "you," the very essence of Moshe, to connect with every Jew.

The connection initiated by Moshe also has a bonding effect within the Jews themselves, making them -- even those on the lowest levels, those for whom Moshe prayed, "If not, obliterate me..." -- one entity. Simultaneously, the connection with Moshe binds and connects the Jewish people with the Or Ein Sof, G-d's infinite light.

Moshe serves as a "shepherd of faith," sustaining and nurturing the Jewish people's faith in G-d by prompting the expression of the essential bond they share with Him.

The two interpretations of the bonds evoked by Moshe are interrelated. By revealing the essential G-dly potential every Jew possesses, Moshe establishes bonds of connection among the Jewish people themselves. For this G-dly potential exists within every member of our people without exception. And it is through highlighting this shared spiritual resource that true unity can be established.

## So that an Eternal Light Will Shine

Although the Torah reading focuses on the priesthood and Aharon's service, Moshe's influence was necessary to lift Aharon's service to a level to which it could not reach on its own. This is reflected in the continuation of the charge to Moshe, "And they shall bring you clear olive oil, crushed for the lamp."

One might ask: why should the oil be brought to Moshe? It was Aharon who kindled the menorah. The answer is found in the continuation of the verse, "to raise an eternal light." Aharon has the potential to spark the divine service of the Jews and inspire them with light and warmth, but for the flame to burn as "an eternal light," "from evening until morning," Moshe's influence is necessary. For it is Moshe who enables every Jew to tap his innermost spiritual resources and maintain a constant commitment.

For similar reasons, the investiture of Aharon and his sons in the priesthood was performed by Moshe. For the seven days of the initiation of the altar, Moshe served as a priest. His service enhanced Aharon's subsequent efforts, contributing a deeper dimension of connection to G-d.

## The Agent of Redemption

With regard to Moshe, our Sages state: "He is the first redeemer, and he will be the ultimate redeemer." The natural result of the arousal of the essential connection to G-d and the unity among mankind introduced by Moshe is the Redemption.

In this vein, our Sages explain that the redemption from Egypt had the potential to be the ultimate redemption. Had the Jews' sins not prevented Moshe from leading the people into Eretz Yisrael, there never would have been another exile.

Similarly, in subsequent generations, it is the "extensions of Moshe Rabbeinu" who infuse the yearning for redemption among our people, uniting them in the desire for Mashiach's coming. These efforts serve as an "eternal light," pointing our people and mankind as a whole to its ultimate goal.
