## What the Torah Chooses to Highlight

Every school child knows the story of Avraham -- how he discovered G-d as a child, broke his father's idols, and then was thrown into the furnace by Nimrod and saved by G-d. None of these particulars, however, can be found in the Written Torah. It is in Parshas Lech Lecha, with the command, "Go out of your land, your native country, and your father's house," that the Torah begins highlighting the history of Avraham as the founder of our people.

What is at the heart of this choice of emphasis? Before receiving this command, Avraham had already attained high rungs in his divine service. All this, however, represented merely his own striving to unite with G-d. Receiving the command Lech Lecha, "Go out of your land," began a new and deeper stage in Avraham's relationship with G-d. For, as our Sages state, "a person who observes a mitzvah because he is commanded to do so is greater than one who observes it without having been so commanded."

The word mitzvah and the word tzavta, meaning "together", share the same root. When a person fulfills a divine command because he has been commanded to do so, the act which he performs is G-dly, and connects him to G-d in all His infinity. If he performs the same deed without having been commanded to do so, his act, however worthy, remains merely a good deed: it does not establish a connection of the same nature.

## New Vistas

Lech also means "proceed," indicating the beginning of an ongoing journey of divine service. Real progress means leaving one's previous state entirely. As long as an individual's personal growth depends on his own power alone, his progress will be limited. He cannot go beyond the bounds of his own understanding. When, by contrast, his progress is guided by G-d's commandments, there are no limits to the potential for growth. The Torah and its mitzvos can take a person far beyond his own vistas.

To accentuate this point, the command Lech Lecha tells Avraham to proceed "to the land which I will show you" without mentioning a specific destination. For following G-d's commandments brings a person to horizons which he could not appreciate on his own.

## Self-discovery

The expression "I will show you," Ar-ecka in Hebrew, can also be rendered "I will reveal you," i.e., through the journey to Eretz Yisrael, Avraham's true self was revealed. This is also indicated by the expression Lech Lecha, which literally means "go to yourself," i.e., "to your essence," to the very source of the soul.

This also points to an unlimited potential, for a Jew's soul is "an actual part of G-d." A person's spiritual journey involves transcending his ordinary habits and ways of thinking, and tapping his essential G-dly core. As we proceed through life, each of us is given the chance to discover who he is, what G-d is, and that the two are in essence one.

## Passing Through Shadows

In the midst of his spiritual journey, a person may be forced to confront challenges, situations which require him to struggle to continue to advance. Nevertheless, since these phases of his journey are also guided by Divine Providence, he must realize that the motivating intent for them is also positive. These situations are, to borrow an expression from our Sages, a descent for the purpose of ascent.

Avraham's spiritual journey also contained such phases. Shortly after he entered Eretz Yisrael, he was forced to descend to Egypt. Egypt is described as "the nakedness of the land;" its very name mitzrayim is related to the word meitzarim meaning "boundaries" or "limitations."

And yet, Avraham's descent to Egypt brought him blessing. He left Egypt "very rich in cattle, in silver, and gold." Moreover, this material wealth came from spiritual effort; Avraham had elevated the sparks of G-dliness invested in that land.

## To Journey With Others

A person's spiritual quest should not be a lonely journey. On the contrary, one of the signs of one's personal development is the capacity to inspire others to join in this endeavor. This concept is also reflected in the changing of his name from Avram to Avraham. Rashi explains that Avram has the implication "father of Aram," while Avraham alludes to the Hebrew words meaning "father of many nations."

## A Sign in Our Flesh

Significantly, Avraham was given this name in connection with the mitzvah of circumcision. Circumcision, the mitzvah which affects the most material aspects of our being, demonstrates that our spiritual quest is not an attempt to escape our worldly reality, but rather an attempt to refine it. Circumcision represents a "covenant in the flesh," and endows our physical bodies themselves with a dimension of holiness.

## The Promise of Eretz Yisrael

Circumcision reflects the unification of the spiritual and the physical in one's own person, while the relationship between the Jews and Eretz Yisrael reflects the unification of spirituality and physicality in the world at large. In this sense, the promise of Eretz Yisrael represents the culmination of Avraham's spiritual journey. For the most complete departure from a particular spiritual environment is the transformation of that environment itself.

In a complete sense, the promise of Eretz Yisrael will not be realized until the Era of the Redemption and in that sense, the journey of Lech Lecha remains an ongoing endeavor for all of Avraham's descendants. Until the coming of Mashiach, we are constantly in a state of flux, going beyond the limits of our immediate spiritual level and striving to bring ourselves and our surrounding environment to its ultimate state of fulfillment.
