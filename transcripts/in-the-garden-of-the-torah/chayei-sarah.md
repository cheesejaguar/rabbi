## What Death Cannot Quench

The name of this week's Torah reading, Chayei Sarah ("The life of Sarah"), evokes an obvious question: The reading begins by telling of Sarah's death and this event features in many of the subsequent narratives. Why then is the reading entitled "The life of Sarah"?

This question can be resolved on the basis of our Sages' statement, that "Yaakov, our Patriarch, did not die." Although he was mourned and buried, however, since his children -- and their descendants -- continue to perpetuate his spiritual heritage, Yaakov is still alive.

The same is true for any individual. It is our spiritual content, and not our physical existence, which is the fundamental element of our lives. And the limits of our mortal existence cannot confine that spiritual content.

This is the point of the name of this Torah reading: to show how Sarah's spiritual endeavors continued to bear fruit after her lifetime ended.

## Concentration and Focus

What constituted Sarah's fundamental thrust in divine service? She was Avraham's wife. She developed and nurtured his potential, making sure that it was applied in the most beneficial manner possible.

Avraham dispensed kindness freely, generously granting hospitality to all wayfarers, without concern whether his influence would leave a lasting impression or not. Sarah, by contrast, (particularly after the birth of Yitzchak) directed her efforts towards focusing and concentrating this influence. She sought to direct it to recipients who would give it expression in the realm of holiness.

This pattern is reflected in Avraham's progeny. He fathered many children. Sarah, by contrast, bore only Yitzchak. And Avraham's unbounded generosity caused him to appreciate Yishmael as good. Therefore even after G-d told him of the impending birth of Yitzchak, he prayed, "May Yishmael live before You."

It was Sarah who demanded: "Drive away this maidservant and her son, for [he]... will not inherit together with my son, with Yitzchak." Sarah understood that the members of Avraham's household could be only such individuals whose conduct reflected Avraham's spiritual heritage.

## Eretz Yisrael: Our People's Exclusive Heritage

With regard to the purchase of the Cave of Machpelah: Avraham had been promised the inheritance of Eretz Yisrael beforehand. Nevertheless, that promise had not been realized. It was through the acquisition of the Cave of Machpelah -- obviously associated with Sarah -- that a part of Eretz Yisrael first became an eternal heritage for the Jewish people. For the first time, the spiritual nature of our holy land was given actual expression.

Our Sages state that Adam and Chavah, the ancestors of the entire human race, were also buried in the Cave of Machpelah. Thus before Sarah's burial, the Cave of Machpelah shared a connection with mankind as a whole. Sarah's burial -- in continuation of the pattern she exhibited throughout her lifetime -- established it as the exclusive heritage of the Jewish people.

## A Wife for Yitzchak

With regard to the marriage of Yitzchak and Rivkah, it was the fact that Sarah's spiritual virtues were reflected in Rivkah which endeared her to Yitzchak. When he saw that her Shabbos candles burned from Shabbos to Shabbos, that the dough she made rose with a special blessing, and that a cloud of glory hovered over her tent, he knew that his mother's lifework would be given continued expression. It was then that "Yitzchak was consoled after [the loss of] his mother."

## Avraham's Heir

Even the final element of the Torah reading, the story of Avraham fathering other progeny also demonstrates a continuation of Sarah's influence. For although Avraham fathered these children, "he gave everything he owned to Yitzchak." To these children, "he gave gifts, and while he was still alive, sent them eastward, to the eastern lands, away from his son Yitzchak."

Due to continuing influence of Sarah, Avraham demonstrated that he considered Yitzchak alone as his true heir. Moreover, even Yishmael acknowledged this distinction and, at Avraham's burial, he gave Yitzchak precedence despite the fact that Yishmael was older.

## Ongoing Influence

The name Sarah is associated with the Hebrew word Serara meaning "dominion." For Sarah's life-work involved showing the supremacy of Avraham's heritage, revealing that the totality of existence was created to express these qualities.

Her death did not halt the effects of her influence. As the events in the Torah reading indicate, her efforts continued to bear fruit, thus showing how she possessed and radiated true life. The positive activities a person performs within his lifetime precipitate others. Thus the goodness which a person endows his family and environment is a positive force that creates an ongoing dynamic toward good. And this dynamic will continue to bear fruit after the person's passing, increasing the goodness and virtue in the world until the coming of the Era of the Redemption, when these forces will permeate all existence.
