# Bereishis - "In the Beginning": A Dwelling for G-d

## Purpose and Its Realization

When a person is sent to accomplish a task, his purpose should be clearly outlined. Sometimes, however, an explicit statement of intent is not made. Instead, an allusion is given, and the person charged with the mission is left to discover its purpose on his own.

Why would someone choose to issue instructions in such a manner? When the purpose is clearly spelled out for the agent, its realization is not his own. He is borrowing someone else's conception. When, by contrast, he comes to this awareness on his own, it rings far truer within him; it is part of his own thinking.

Similar ideas apply with regard to G-d's creation of the world. When the Torah begins describing creation, its first words are not "Let there be light." Instead, before mentioning light, it speaks of "nothingness, void and darkness." Why?

Our Sages explain G-d's motive for creation as "a desire" for "a dwelling in the lower realms." A dwelling means a home, a place where His essence is manifest. The term "lower realms" refers to our material world where G-dliness cannot be perceived. Moreover, G-d wants that dwelling to be part and parcel of the lower realms themselves. His intent is not to nullify the limitations of our material existence, but rather to manifest Himself within our present framework.

## Where Opposites Meet

Had G-d begun the creation with light, i.e., were He to have created a world that recognizes Him effortlessly, there would never been a "lower realm"; all existence would have been one with Him. This was not His desire. G-d wants man to exist in a world which by nature makes man feel separate from Him, but that man should, nevertheless, ultimately achieve the awareness described by Isaiah: "the world will be filled with the knowledge of G-d as the waters cover the ocean bed."

Reaching such awareness represents a fusion of opposites. But precisely such a fusion reveals G-d's essence. For He is neither light, nor darkness; neither finite, nor infinite. No worldly quality -- nor its antithesis -- can define Him. When, however, we see two contradictory thrusts joining together, we can appreciate that this is possible only because He has manifest Himself. And precisely such a manifestation will characterize the Era of the Redemption, the era when it will be revealed that the world is G-d's dwelling.

## Two Beginnings

To make this possible, G-d began creation with "nothingness, void, and darkness." This would insure that there would be a concept of "lower realms." But to insure that these "lower realms" would be transformed into a "dwelling" for Him, "in the beginning" He invested two unique elements within creation.

Thus with regard to the name of this week's Torah reading, Bereishis, Rashi comments: It is as if this word bereishis, "in the beginning" begs "Extrapolate upon my meaning." The word can be divided as beis reishis "two entities which are called 'beginning'". As our Sages commented: creation is for the sake of the Torah which is referred to as "the beginning of His path" and for the sake of the righteous who are referred to as "the beginning of His crop."

As opposed to the world at large which appears to exist independent of its G-dly source, "Yisrael, the Torah, and the Holy One, blessed be He, are all one." Every Jew's soul is "an actual part of G-d" and the Torah is G-d's will and wisdom. Since the Torah and the Jewish people are one with G-d, the observance of the Torah and its mitzvos by the Jews in this material world consummates G-d's dwelling and expresses the purpose of creation.

"A mitzvah is a candle, and the Torah, light." Using the light of Torah, the Jews can reveal the fundamental G-dly intent imbued within the world and show that it is G-d's dwelling.

## Partners in Creation

And yet, the above emphasis on the Torah and the Jewish people is not explicit in the word Bereishis. On the contrary, the simple meaning of the word is "in the beginning," indicating that creation is the first phase in an ongoing process of growth. This highlights the importance of man's contribution. For man is intended to be G-d's "partner in creation," continuing and bringing to fruition G-d's desire for a dwelling.

G-d created a material world. He left to man the task of revealing the spiritual, showing how the world is His dwelling. Man begins in a world of darkness, and endeavors to endow it with light. And each glimmer of light encourages others, for "a little light banishes a great deal of darkness," and leads to the ultimate light, the light of Redemption, when it will be openly revealed that the world is G-d's dwelling.

The Tzemach Tzedek used to say, "According to the stance one adopts on Shabbos Bereishis, the entire year follows." For every year is a renewal of the cycle of creation. The Zohar states that "G-d looked into the Torah and created the world. A man looks into the Torah and maintains the world." As we begin the study of the Torah anew on this Shabbos, we have the potential to renew the entire creation, and bring it to its ultimate goal.
