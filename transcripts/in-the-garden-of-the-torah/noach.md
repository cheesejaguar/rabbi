## Our Potential for Achievement

The Maggid of Mezritch would interpret our Sages' statement: "Know what is above you," as follows: "Know that everything above" -- all that transpires in the spiritual realms -- is "from you," dependent on your conduct. Each of us has the potential to influence even the most elevated spiritual realms. The Torah alludes to this potential in the opening verse of our Torah reading, "These are the chronicles of Noach. Noach was a righteous man."

Noach refers to satisfaction and repose. By repeating his name, the Torah implies that Noach -- and by extension, every one of his descendants -- can spread these qualities in two spheres: among his fellow men, and also in the spiritual worlds above.

Every person affects his environment. We can promote peace and tranquillity among our fellow men, creating a setting that prompts meaningful pleasure. And by establishing such a setting in our world, we generate similar qualities in the spiritual worlds above.

## To Be Sensitive to G-d's Cues

This name is, however, problematic for the portion as a whole does not reflect these qualities. On the contrary, the majority of the portion concerns the story of the flood, and its conclusion relates the story of the Tower of Bavel. These events -- and the conduct of mankind which led to them -- represent the direct opposite of the satisfaction and repose personified by Noach.

The resolution of this difficulty underscores the interrelation between the patterns G-d intends for our world and man's response to them. Noach's birth was to begin a period of repose and satisfaction that would encompass the world at large. Mankind had the choice to take an active part in that undertaking, but by and large, this option was not seized. Instead, each person went about his life, concerned with his own priorities, and indeed, only with himself -- what another person felt or what was right did not matter. And as a result, "The world was corrupt... and the land was filled with crime."

## Waters of Blessing

Then it started to rain. On the verse, "And it rained for forty days and forty nights on the land," our Sages commented: "At the outset, the water descended [gently,] with mercy, so that if they would repent, they would be rains of blessing. Since they did not repent, it became a flood."

The flood waters were intended to be waters of blessing. For the blessing to be openly manifest, however, the people had to make themselves fit to receive G-d's influence, and therefore teshuvah -- turning to G-d and improving their conduct -- was necessary.

Even after the people did not turn to G-d in teshuvah, the rains remained waters of blessing. The flood purified the land. The forty days of the flood resembled the forty seah of mikveh. Just as immersion in the mikveh is associated with reliving the act of creation, renewing vitality, so too, the forty days of the flood brought about the dawning of a new age: "Noach saw a new world."

Therefore, the waters of the flood are called "the waters of Noach," because their intent -- and their actual effect -- was to bring rest and pleasure to the world. Unfortunately, however, because of man's conduct, this positive intent required a form of expression that was coupled with destruction.

## Kindness with Purpose

A similar concept applies with regard to the sin of the Tower of Babel as reflected in our Sages' teaching, "There were ten generations from Noach to Avraham.... All those generations repeatedly angered Him, until Avraham our father came and received the reward of them all."

The generations that preceded Avraham shared a kindred spirit and treated each other with love. Nevertheless, since they "repeatedly angered G-d," their conduct did not reflect the repose and satisfaction G-d intended for mankind. Therefore, He punished them, scattering them throughout the earth.

Avraham performed deeds of kindness and hospitality. All of these deeds had a single thrust and purpose -- to make all mankind conscious of G-d. Through his deeds, he communicated the desired forms of repose and satisfaction, and therefore, received the reward generated by all the comradely deeds of the generations which preceded him.

## When the Rainbow Will Shine

Our Torah portion also foreshadows the ultimate state of repose and satisfaction to be reached in the era when "there will be neither famine nor war, neither envy nor competition, for good things will flow in abundance."

On the ark were lions, tigers, and other predators and yet, they dwelt in peace with other animals, anticipating the fulfillment of the prophecy, "The wolf will dwell with lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat."

By manifesting these qualities in our conduct at present, we can precipitate the coming of that age. And then like Noach and his sons, we will merit the shining of the rainbow with brilliant colors. For the Zohar states "The rainbow reflects the spiritual secrets.... When you see the rainbow shining with bright colors, wait for the Mashiach's coming."
