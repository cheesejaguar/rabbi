## 1. Bribed by Candy

The Rebbe Rayatz once shared a teaching from R. Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev, who declared before his passing: "There have been tzaddikim who before their passing promised that they would not enter the Garden of Eden until they had ensured the coming of Mashiach -- except that ultimately they were duped, and allowed themselves to be bribed by bits of candy [spiritual bliss]."

The Rebbe Rayatz concluded this anecdote by noting: "Ultimately, however, they fooled him, too. They said Kedushah in Gan Eden, and R. Levi Yitzchak jumped right in!"

However, the Rebbe Rayatz possessed full awareness of this pattern. Having related this teaching, "he assuredly saw to it that this would not happen to himself. The Rebbe [Rayatz] will certainly bring Mashiach."

## 2. Two Levels of Self-Sacrifice

The distinction between other tzaddikim and the Rebbe Rayatz reflects two different forms of mesirus nefesh (self-sacrifice) explained in Chassidus.

R. Akiva actively pursued mesirus nefesh, stating: "All my days I have been troubled [by the verse commanding love of G-d 'with all your soul'... 'When will I be granted the opportunity of fulfilling it?']"

By contrast, Avraham Avinu did not seek mesirus nefesh. His spiritual dedication focused on disseminating knowledge of G-dliness throughout the world. When mesirus nefesh became necessary, he was prepared to undertake it.

The fundamental difference: R. Akiva sought what he considered spiritually noble for himself. Avraham Avinu "sought nothing whatever for himself (not even mesirus nefesh); rather, he was devoted and dedicated with all his essence to disseminating the knowledge of G-dliness in the world."

This distinction illuminates the current subject. Other tzaddikim promised not to enter the Garden of Eden until securing Mashiach's arrival -- an act of mesirus nefesh where they chose to forego Eden's bliss. The Rebbe Rayatz, however, possessed no independent existence. His "entire being is devoted and dedicated to the whole House of Israel, his activity toward securing the bringing of Mashiach for the sake of all of Israel is not 'self-sacrifice': it is simply his very being."

Consequently, while spiritual revelations could tempt other tzaddikim, "the Rebbe [Rayatz] cannot be bribed with such promises. For this reason, it is certain that the Rebbe [Rayatz] will bring Mashiach."

## 3. More than During his Lifetime

Following his passing and ascent to sublime spiritual heights, the Rebbe Rayatz remains equally committed to Mashiach's arrival in this physical world below. In fact, the worldly realm matters to him even more profoundly now.

The Alter Rebbe writes in Iggeres HaKodesh, explaining Zohar teachings: "when a tzaddik departs he is to be found in all the worlds more than during his lifetime...; even in this world of action... he is to be found more [than during his lifetime]."

The Alter Rebbe articulated this concept regarding R. Menachem Mendel of Horodok, who was not among Chabad's Rebbeim. By extension, the Rebbe Rayatz -- a Chabad leader -- must be "found more than during his lifetime, and that what goes on down here is of the greatest concern to him."

Therefore, heavenly attractions cannot divert him from his purpose. He will undoubtedly "bring our righteous Mashiach."
