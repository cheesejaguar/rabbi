# Beis Nissan: From Strength to Strength

**Date:** 25 Adar, 5710 (1950)
**Source:** Proceeding Together, Volume 1 - Sichos In English

The date Beis Nissan holds dual significance: it marks the anniversary of the Rebbe Rashab's passing and the day his son -- the Rebbe Rayatz -- became the leader of their generation.

Spiritual energies associated with these events are rekindled annually. Over thirty years (5680-5709/1920-1949), the Rebbe Rashab ascended thirty levels of elevation. This reflects the teaching that tzaddikim "proceed from strength to strength" even after death, becoming more present in all worlds than during their lifetime.

The benefactions the Rebbe relays to his followers come from ever higher sources. Those wishing to receive these blessings must attune their spiritual capacities accordingly.

As the second of Nissan approaches, followers should strengthen their connection to the Rebbe Rayatz through his teachings, letters, and talks. They should recognize the Rebbe continues his spiritual work, protecting and directing material and spiritual blessings toward his followers.
