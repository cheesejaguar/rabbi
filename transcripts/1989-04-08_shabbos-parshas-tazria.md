The Torah describes the month of Nissan as "The head of the months, the first of the months of the year." This indicates Nissan contains unique lessons relevant to Jewish service throughout the year.

"The head of the months" reflects the relationship between Nissan and other months like the head and limbs. While Rosh HaShanah refers to G-d's relationship with the Jewish people within nature's context, Nissan serves "the head of the months" regarding transcendent aspects that exceed natural boundaries.

The Sages stated: "When G-d chose His world, He established Roshei Chadoshim and years. When He chose Jacob and his sons, He established for them a Rosh Chodesh of redemption." The "choice of the world" establishes nature's laws; the "choice of Ya'akov and his sons" establishes a transcendent connection with Jews.

The exodus from Egypt exemplifies this -- completely impossible by natural law. Egypt (Mitzrayim) relates to meitzarim, meaning "boundaries" or "limitations." The exodus freed Jews from these constraints through numerous miracles, with miraculous phenomena layered within miracles.

Nature versus Miracles: Teva (nature) means "sunk," implying hidden G-dly energy. The world appears self-directed on the surface. Nais (miracle) associates with elevation; miracles reveal G-dly energy openly.

Service of G-d approaches: One service follows nature: studying because diligent by nature, giving charity because naturally generous. The Tanya calls this "one who does not serve G-d" -- service remains limited by natural tendencies.

True service involves transcending nature (innate tendencies plus adopted habits) without considering worldly limitations. The Tanya illustrates: "A 'servant of G-d' studies his portion one hundred and one times, while 'one who does not serve Him' studies only one hundred times."

The extra review, surpassing customary patterns since youth, characterizes true service. Once one-hundred-and-one times becomes habitual, one-hundred-and-two repetitions become necessary for the title "servant of G-d." Each transcendence becomes the new baseline.

The Baal Shem Tov taught that after miracles repeat, they become nature -- requiring even greater wonders to constitute miracles. Similarly, after transcending nature once, one must reach higher service levels.

Nissan's annual renewal: Each Nissan brings fresh dimensions surpassing previous miracles and transcendence. Jews receive new transcendent energies allowing escape from nature's and personal limitations -- even patterns from holiness. One reaches entirely new plains achieving success transcending nature, accomplishing tasks previously deemed miraculous.

Nissan, as "the head of the months," extends this approach throughout the year, transforming miraculous service into one's very nature.

This relates to the Sages' expression: "when the Holy One, Blessed be He, chose Ya'akov and his sons." This choice -- at exodus and more completely at Torah-giving -- elevated Jews above creation's limits. At Sinai, G-d "chose us from among the nations and lifted us above all tongues," establishing us as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation."

"Priest" means servant. The Sages taught: "the servant of a king is a king." Kings transcend nature's limits; "servants of kings" possess similar qualities. Jews, as G-d's servants, inherit these properties, as G-d isn't bound by nature's or miracles' limitations. Torah-giving established Jews as His servants, transforming their nature transcendentally.

Why this works: Nature and miracles represent different perspectives -- whether G-dly energy is hidden (nature) or revealed (miracles). G-d created both; from His perspective, no difference exists.

When Jews connect with G-d, their nature transcends natural limits. Therefore, miracles and transcendent service aren't considered wondrous by them, as they aren't for G-d.

Revelation through service: Jews must reveal this through service. While inhabiting physical bodies in material worlds under nature's dominion, they demonstrate their G-d service transcends restrictions -- not as wondrous, but natural. As Jews, they rely on miracles.

The Sages taught: "Do not rely on miracles" -- referring to matters one considers miraculous. However, once miracles become one's nature, relying on future miracles is permissible, enabling progression to higher levels.

Yearly progression: Yearly, new service dimensions emerge. Previous impossibilities now appear normal, accomplished effortlessly (though others wonder). This pattern motivates summoning energies for even higher service. From Nissan, this continues through following months.

Practical lesson: Every Jew must declare -- through personal example and speech -- that beginning anew, he conducts everyday affairs miraculously. The world observes amazement at how Jews' natural behavior transcends nature, remaining unmoved, regarding it normally.

When asked: "How can flesh-and-blood humans apparently bound by nature transcend limitations?" -- Jews answer they were born Jewish, members of "a kingdom of priests." This isn't historical; it's constant, eternal, affecting all Jews always. Therefore, as "a servant of a king" who is "a king," and since "the Holy One, Blessed be He, and Israel are one," they possess transcendent potential.

This applies even in exile and diaspora. Though G-d's wonders aren't openly revealed as during Temple times, greater miracles exist now -- highest levels connect with lowest. Jews in exile, preceding Mashiach's arrival, possess great granted powers. Previous generations' service refined and elevated the world, making transcendent Jewish service easier.

Summary: Jews must declare through personal example that as Jews, normal behavior exceeds the norm, transcending nature. Through Nissan's influence, they rise higher.

Each person should accept previously-rejected Torah study, charity, or prayer goals, believing capability exists. Success is assured.

Following "Love your neighbor as yourself," additionally influencing others to adopt similar approaches demonstrates proper concern. Since Pesach approaches (two weeks away), giving and influencing others toward Maos Chittim and Pesach needs is appropriate, particularly attending to poor community members.

Connection to the Torah portion: The weekly portion begins: "If a woman conceives and gives birth to a male...." G-d's relationship with Jews (the whole people and each individual) parallels husband-wife relationships. G-d provides each Jew all needs and transcendent service potential. The two join dynamically: "the Holy One, Blessed be He, and Israel are one" -- resembling marriage bonds.

This enables each Jew to "conceive and give birth" -- our Sages declared: "The progeny of the righteous are good deeds." Offspring will be "male"; our Sages stated, "the tendency of a male is to conquer." Through this service, one conquers and transforms the entire world's nature.

The above receives greater emphasis on the third of Nissan, associated with the Nassi of the tribe of Zevulun.

Generally, Jews divide into two groupings: Yissachar, Torah scholars (whose behavior associates with the miraculous order described), and Zevulun, those involved in business (engaged with natural order).

Broadly, the entire Jewish people associate with Zevulun, as even primary Torah students must give charity and perform kindness. Additionally, since Torah study's ultimate realization occurs only in the Messianic age, current Torah study of all Jews can be considered Zevulun's service. The day when the Nassi of Zevulun's portion is read, emphasis must stress Zevulun's service relevance to all Jews and service's positive qualities.

Zevulun's service as metaphor: Broadly, Zevulun's business activity metaphorically represents a Jew's world service, acquiring world elements for G-d, making the public domain -- where business occurs -- private for G-d. This service generates profit: the soul's descent causes it to rise to higher holiness.

Though today (Shabbos) forbids business activity simply, business conducted for G-d -- involving holy matter activities, Torah study, and prayer -- is permitted and desirable on Shabbos.

Nissan's contribution: Nissan adds dimensions to this service. Though involved with worldly things governed by nature's rules, because one "does business for G-d," one receives transcendent potential exceeding natural limits. This brings profit: "The L-rd, your G-d, will bless you in all that you do," particularly when everything serves G-d.

Another Shabbos aspect: it follows the second of Nissan, the yahrzeit of the Rebbe Rashab and the day the Previous Rebbe began his Nesius.

The Rebbe Rashab founded Yeshivah Tomchei Temimim; branches subsequently spread worldwide.

Tomchei Temimim's unique aspect: Nigleh (Torah's halachic dimension) and Pnimiyus HaTorah (Chassidus teachings) are studied unified. Furthermore, this study occurs in a settled and permanent manner. This study motivated yeshivah students, families, and influenced people toward Torah study commitment, complete mitzvah performance, and world service via "all your deeds will be for the sake of heaven," with mesirus nefesh approaches.

Though service sometimes involved difficulty, particularly when in Russia, currently no obstacles exist. Fulfilling the founder's desires in all yeshivah-intended areas is much easier. Possibilities exist to increase and add to these general goals -- Torah and Yiddishkeit spreading, and particularly Chassidus wellspring spreading outward.

All yeshivah-studied individuals (or those who sent children there) should meditate on the yeshivah's effects and its continued impact regarding strengthening Torah study (Nigleh and Pnimiyus HaTorah), fullest mitzvah fulfillment, G-d service through prayer, and "all one's deeds for the sake of Heaven," and "Knowing Him in all your ways."

This is particularly appropriate as this marks the seventieth year since the Rebbe Rashab's passing and the fortieth year since the Previous Rebbe's passing. This will add to Jewish people's generational service -- previous generations' service paving the way for current service. Particularly, spreading Chassidus wellsprings outward -- strengthened by Tomchei Temimim's founding -- will bring Mashiach's coming and ultimate, complete redemption.

Then, "as in the days of your exodus from Egypt, I will show you wonders." This verse interprets as G-d revealing wonders each Jew accomplishes in His service and Messianic redemption miracles being considered wondrous even regarding exodus miracles. Together, we'll proceed to Eretz Yisrael, Jerusalem, and the Temple, where "we will eat from the sacrifices and the Paschal offerings."
