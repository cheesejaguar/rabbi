This chapter discusses the Yartzeit (anniversary of passing) of the Tzemach Tzedek, the third Rebbe of Chabad, who passed away on the 13th of Nissan in 5626. According to the teaching, a Yartzeit represents more than a simple memorial -- it marks a spiritual occasion when "all the effort of man, which his soul toiled during his lifetime...becomes revealed."

The teaching compares a tzaddik's passing to the parah adumah (red heifer) sacrifice, suggesting it atones for severe transgressions. The Yartzeit generates blessings for Jews who study the tzaddik's teachings and emulate their actions.

## The Tzemach Tzedek's Unique Contributions

**Torah Unification**: Unlike predecessors who studied revealed and mystical Torah separately, the Tzemach Tzedek fused these disciplines. His teachings integrated Talmudic discussions within Chassidic discourse, presenting them as "one Torah."

**Jewish Unity**: The Tzemach Tzedek championed harmony between different Torah study groups. He earned recognition as a halachic authority even among non-Chassidic scholars while simultaneously being called "the Rambam of Chassidus."

## Advocacy and Self-Sacrifice

The chapter emphasizes his mesirus nefesh (self-sacrifice) fighting Russian government educational restrictions and helping cantonists -- Jewish children forcibly conscripted into the Russian army. His influence was so significant that even antisemitic military authorities permitted him to address soldiers.

## Contemporary Application

The text encourages modern readers to emulate these practices by disseminating Jewish teachings at all spiritual levels and pursuing Jewish unity with dedication.
