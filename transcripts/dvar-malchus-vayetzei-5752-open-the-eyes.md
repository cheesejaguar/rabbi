This talk was given on Shabbos Vayeitze in 5752, coinciding with the 9th of Kislev -- the birthday and passing of the Mitteler Rebbe, the second leader of Chabad.

## Key Concepts

The article contrasts two attributes: the Alter Rebbe embodied Chochma (wisdom), while the Mitteler Rebbe represents Bina (understanding). The Mitteler Rebbe's teachings are described as "wide as a river," enabling deeper engagement with inner Torah teachings.

## Central Message

Studying inner Torah through Chassidic teachings while following rabbinical guidance is essential for bringing redemption. Specifically, learning about Moshiach and Geuloh should not remain theoretical but rather "opens the heart and the eyes and the ears" for tangible understanding.

## The Call to Action

Rather than treating these studies as intellectual exercises, the teaching stresses perceiving that "this [redemption] is already prepared and ready," requiring only that people "open the eyes and then he will see this."

## Readiness Assessment

Jews, the world, and even nations descended from Esav are spiritually prepared. The sole remaining requirement involves Jewish recognition of this state of readiness and acknowledgment of who merits redemption.
