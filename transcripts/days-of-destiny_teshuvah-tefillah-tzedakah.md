Teshuvah, tefillah and tzedakah are concepts much more profound than their translations suggest and fundamentally exist only within Jewish tradition.

Between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, Jews are granted ten days to strengthen their relationship with the Divine through these three spiritual practices, enabling G-d to bestow additional blessings beyond the initial judgment.

## Teshuvah (Return)

Rather than mere regret, teshuvah emphasizes "return" to one's essential nature. A Jew is intrinsically good, and sin represents something foreign adhering to the person rather than reflecting their true self. This concept applies universally — even the righteous constantly strive to deepen their connection to their source.

## Tefillah (Union)

Distinguished from supplication, tefillah represents "union with G-d." While prayer involves requesting fulfillment, tefillah focuses on achieving communion with the Divine, strengthening the bond between soul and Creator that physical existence can weaken.

## Tzedakah (Justice)

Contrary to charity's voluntary benevolence, tzedakah embodies "justice" — an obligation grounded in the principle that possessions are held in trust and that giving transcends natural self-interest, inviting Divine reciprocity.
