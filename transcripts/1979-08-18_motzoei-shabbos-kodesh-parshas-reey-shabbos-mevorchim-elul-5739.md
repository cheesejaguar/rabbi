## 1. The Unique Nature of Elul

Although each Shabbos Mevorchim shares common features through recited prayers, every month possesses distinct characteristics. The Hebrew word "Chodesh" (month) means "new," signifying that each month introduces novel dimensions rather than merely repeating previous cycles. These differences reshape the nature of Shabbos Mevorchim accordingly.

Elul serves as preparation for the approaching year, encompassing all forthcoming days and months. The coming year occupies an elevated spiritual state compared to the previous cycle. As the Alter Rebbe writes in Tanya: "a new more sublime divine light descends, so sublime a light that has never shone yet since the beginning of the world."

Since Elul prepares for Rosh Hashanah -- the world's creation anniversary -- it connects with three services sustaining existence: Torah, Avodah (prayer/service), and Gemilus Chassadim (kindness deeds). The Mishnah establishes that "the world stands on three things: Torah, Avodah...and Gemilus Chassadim."

The word Elul functions as an acronym for Biblical verses describing these services:
- "Ani L'dodi V'dodi Li" (I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine) represents prayer
- "Ish L'rayahu U'matonos L'evyonim" (sending portions each man to his friend and presents to the poor) represents kindness
- "Ina L'yado V'samti L'cha" (causing something to come to hand and appointing a place of refuge) relates to Torah study, as sages noted "the words of Torah provide refuge"

### Sin and Restoration

Creation began in complete perfection. However, subsequent sin altered the world's fundamental nature. Therefore, Elul also connects with Teshuvah (repentance). The word Elul serves as an acronym for: "Es L'vovcha V'es L'vav" (G-d will circumcise your heart and the heart of your children), referencing repentance's service.

Elul further connects with creation's ultimate fulfillment. The future world will achieve even greater perfection than creation's beginning, realized through Messianic redemption. This connection appears in Elul's acronym: "Ashira L'Hashem Vayomru Lamor" (I will sing to G-d and they spoke saying) -- words from the song Moshe and the Jewish people sang after the Red Sea's splitting, which also alludes to final Messianic redemption.

Through service in Torah, Avodah, Gemilus Chassadim, alongside Teshuvah -- fundamental service in the generation of "Ikvese DeMashiach" (the Messiah's footsteps) -- we bring the world to its complete state through Messianic redemption speedily.

## 2. The Elevated Service of Elul

Understanding Elul's preparatory nature clarifies why Jewish service during this month reaches very high levels. The Alter Rebbe explains in Likkutei Torah that G-d's thirteen attributes of mercy reveal themselves throughout Elul. This spiritual revelation determines the love and fear of G-d that Jewish people experience during the coming year.

The Alter Rebbe notes: "Fear and love of G-d cannot be established and implanted in the heart of man through his own efforts alone, but together with the divine light which descends from above." The Tzemach Tzedek similarly writes that complete love and fear require influence from above. In Elul, G-d's thirteen mercy attributes arouse the love and fear each Jew will experience throughout the year.

### The "King in the Field" Parable

A paradox emerges: Elul involves elevated service, yet consists of ordinary weekdays. How can such service occur amid mundane preoccupations?

The Alter Rebbe addresses this through the "king in the field" parable. Before entering his city, a king goes to the field greeting all citizens warmly. Generally, palace entry requires being among the select elite; however, in the field anyone can approach the king, who receives them joyfully and grants requests. During Elul, G-d -- the "King of Kings" -- is "in the field." Anyone desiring to approach can do so. Though ordinary weekdays keep us "in the field" rather than the refined city state requiring palace preparations, during Elul we can approach Him.

The Alter Rebbe continues: even someone in a desert receives Torah's promise: "And you will search from there for the L-rd your G-d and you will find Him." Hope persists even for "the lost in the land of Ashur."

The service distinction between Nissan and Tishrei differs: Nissan involves Tzaddikim's (righteous ones') service while Tishrei involves Teshuvah service. Teshuvah ranks higher, evident from the Zohar's statement: "Mashiach will cause Tzaddikim to do Teshuvah."

Complete Teshuvah connects with Torah study, necessitating increased Torah study during Elul. Because the King is "in the field," we perform Teshuvah; through Torah study, we reach completeness in this service. Every Jew can transition from one extreme to another, finding themselves with the King in the field.

## 3. Elul's Dual Meaning

The word Elul comprises two Hebrew words: "Lo" (with alef, meaning "no") and "Lo" (with vav, meaning "to him" or "his"). The Medrash comments on Psalms 100's verse "He made us and we are his," stating: "Lo with an alef -- we did not create ourselves and Lo with a vav -- to him we complete our souls."

These clauses represent opposite service levels. The first addresses a preliminary stage where one learns "we didn't create ourselves." The second reflects a high level: "to Him we complete our souls." When the Jewish people reach completeness, Torah becomes complete, and the world achieves fulfillment through Mashiach's coming.

## 4. Messianic Connection and Parshas Shoftim

The Messianic redemption connects with Torah's portion read during Minchah: Parshas Shoftim. A major Messianic prophecy states: "I will return your judges to their original positions." This fulfillment parallels present Galus service specified in Parshas Shoftim's opening verse: "Place judges and police at all your gates" -- controlling all bodily activity through Torah judgments.

## 5-6. Bais HaMikdash Construction and the Wood Offering

Previous farbrengens emphasized increasing Torah study from the 15th of Av onward, particularly studying Bais HaMikdash construction laws. The Rambam writes in Yad HaChazakah: "It is a positive commandment to build a house for G-d, prepared to have sacrifices offered in it."

The word "prepared" warrants examination given the Rambam's precise Hebrew phraseology. The Bais HaMikdash's primary purpose was providing a place prepared for sacrifices. Until all sacrifice preparations completed, the Bais HaMikdash remained incomplete, encompassing vessel creation -- a component of the building Mitzvah itself.

### The Wood Offering Discussion

Regarding the 15th of Av's wood offering: the Rashbam notes that people "rejoiced because they had completed such a great Mitzvah" -- cutting wood for sacrificial altars. Yet cutting preceded actual donations on the 20th of Av and 20th of Elul.

This apparent contradiction resolves by recognizing that the Bais HaMikdash's purpose included maintaining all provisions, including wood. Rather than relying on family donations, officials ensured adequate supplies existed. Similar to the "chamber of lambs," the superintendent wouldn't wait for lamb donors; logic compels that lambs were previously prepared.

The Mishnah teaches that all trees except olives and grapevines suited the altar. Priests inspected all wood entering the Bais HaMikdash, ensuring it remained worm-free. Since donors couldn't necessarily know these laws, dependable supplies required institutional maintenance rather than voluntary donations.

A further distinction existed regarding wine: officers instituted a convenience system for wine offerings due to ritual purity's complexity. However, wood qualification standards -- avoiding olive/grapevine varieties and eliminating worms -- remained obviously discernible, requiring no intermediary system.

## 7. The M'koshaish Aitzim (Wood Gatherer)

Previous discussions addressed the M'koshaish Aitzim from Numbers 15:32. Two opinions exist: one labels him a sinner outright; another maintains his intention served heaven, seeking to clarify Shabbat-breaking's Halachic consequences, demonstrating Mesirus Nefesh (self-sacrifice) for Torah's sake.

These correlate with Zohar's statement that "Aitzim" (wood/trees) refers to life's tree and knowledge's tree. Different translations of "M'koshaish" support this: Targum Yonassan translates it as "cut off" while Rashi interprets it as "gather." According to the sin opinion, separating knowledge's tree from life's tree constituted his offense. According to the positive opinion, he connected knowledge's tree to life's tree -- though inappropriate for Shabbat.

## 8. Four Character Types (Pirkei Avos Analysis)

Pirkei Avos Chapter 5, Mishnah 10 describes four character types:
- One saying "What is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine" is ignorant
- One saying "What is mine is mine, and what is yours is yours" represents median characteristic (or Sodom's trait)
- One saying "What is mine is yours, and what is yours is yours" is a "chassid" (pious person)
- One saying "What is yours is mine, and what is mine is mine" is wicked

Pirkei Avos teaches behavior exceeding legal measure. How does this Mishnah reflect such behavior? Additionally, why use "chassid" rather than "Tzaddik"?

The answer involves Mishnah's precise, concise phraseology. It emphasizes what one says rather than merely does. Someone might give begrudgingly while taunting: "What is mine is mine, and what is yours is mine." Torah law doesn't demand more practically; he fulfilled requirements. However, speech-wise his behavior proved improper. Beyond-the-law perspective demands correcting this aspect.

Regarding "What is mine is yours, and what is yours is yours": the Mishnah teaches unique speech-level lessons. The clause describes someone unable to give materially. However, instead of silently retreating, he actively ensures the other feels good, explaining "what is mine is yours." This statement influences them toward eventual giving when they possess means.

## 9. Increased Torah Study and Tzedakah in Elul

The verse "Zion will be redeemed with judgment and its captives with Tzedakah" emphasizes Elul's Torah and Tzedakah connections. Present times represent comfort and consolation for Bais HaMikdash's loss; these services remain important. We must continue Torah and Tzedakah campaigns, increasing personal Torah study and charitable contributions rather than relying solely on spreading efforts among others.

The Alter Rebbe's Shulchan Aruch law reinforces this: from the 15th of Av onward, increase Torah study. Elul similarly connects with Torah study because Rosh Chodesh Elul through Yom Kippur parallel the forty days Moshe spent on Mt. Sinai preparing for the second Tablets' reception. Representing the entire Jewish people, his study model applies universally.

Elul connects with Tzedakah since Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur (Eve and After), Sukkos, Shemini Atzeres, and Simchas Torah involve lavish Yom Tov feasts. Presently, efforts should organize ensuring everyone receives essentials for proper holiday celebration -- accomplished discreetly without identifying recipients.

## 10. The Approaching Shemitah Year

We near the sixth year's close. The approaching Shemitah (Sabbatical) year contains particular laws; some authorities say these commence from the 15th of Av, others from Rosh Chodesh Elul. The Shemitah year -- comparable to Shabbat -- serves as blessing's source for subsequent years.
