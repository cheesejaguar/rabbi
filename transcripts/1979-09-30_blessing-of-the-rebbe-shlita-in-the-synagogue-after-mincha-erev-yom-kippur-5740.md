4. May G-d bless each and every Jew wherever they are and the entire Jewish people to be inscribed for a good and sweet year, with open and revealed good in spiritual and physical matters speedily and very soon.

Since this year began on the �the day of your rejoicing �this is the Shabbos� (Sifri) and also the �season of rejoicing� begins with �the day of your rejoicing � this is the Shabbos�, (and likewise the holiday of Shemini Atzeres is on Shabbos), may all matters be carried out in a manner of �and you shall declare the Shabbos a delight� that all matters and all blessings should be with true pleasure and a pleasure that can be appreciated with physical eyes.

May there be an arousal for the higher level of Teshuvah (the level of Teshuvah that is connected with joy) from G-d form His full, open, holy, and wide hand (and also overflowing hand � as in the Siddur of the Baal Shem Tov, the word �overflowing� was printed instead of holy).

And may this be expressed through Torah study as the Alter Rebbe writes in Iggeres HaTeshuvah that the concept of the higher level of Teshuvah is connected with Torah study (which in turn brings about deed, � the careful (exemplary manner) performance of Mitzvos) with true and revealed joy �and everlasting joy upon their beads.� (Isaiah 35:10)

In the near future we should merit to go �with our young and our old, our sons and daughters,� �a great company shall return there.�

That even in the last days of Golus, the Land of Israel will be complete, together with the completeness of the Torah, and together with the completeness of every person as an individual and from all Jews as our nation who are �sons to Hashem your G-d�

And go greet Mashiach Tzidkeinu, with joy.. Amen so may it be G-d�s will.

Again may we all and the entire Jewish people be inscribed for a good year with open and revealed good.
