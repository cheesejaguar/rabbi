# Rosh HaShanah, 5750

**Date:** September 30, 1989 (1st of Tishrei, 5750)
**Occasion:** Rosh HaShanah
**Source:** Sichos In English, Volume 43

---

The text presents two seemingly contradictory concepts regarding Rosh HaShanah:

## Coronation of G-d

The service centers on "crowning G-d as King of Israel" and "King of the entire world." Coronation involves complete self-negation (bittul), where people surrender individual desires to focus entirely on the king.

## Day of Judgment

Rosh HaShanah is the "day of judgment for man," with emphasis on material concerns. Prayers request inscriptions for "good life," "livelihood and sustenance," and worldly blessings.

## The Apparent Contradiction

These concepts seem incompatible -- how can one seek personal blessings while in complete self-negation before G-d?

## Resolution Through G-d's Essence

The teaching explains that "G-d's essence transcends all our conceptions of existence." It stands above all particular levels. The revelation of Rosh HaShanah relates to this transcendent level and contains two aspects:

1. Because G-d's Essence is above all particular levels, it evokes complete self-negation
2. Because this level transcends even transcendence itself, this self-negation "permeates through to every particular level of existence"

## Parallel in Torah and Mitzvos

The discourse notes that Torah demonstrates unity while containing distinct disciplines. Similarly, mitzvos each have particular nature yet fundamental oneness, reflecting G-d's unified will.

## The Name "Rosh HaShanah" (Head of the Year)

Just as a head includes life force for all body limbs and controls their functioning, Rosh HaShanah includes and controls all days of the year. The question posed: how can something transcending particular divisions control those very divisions?

Answer: Because Rosh HaShanah's source transcends both simplicity and division, it fuses these opposite tendencies.

## Connection to Creation and Adam

Rosh HaShanah is celebrated on the anniversary of the sixth day of creation (humanity's creation). Adam's first actions proclaimed: "The L-rd is king. He clothes Himself in pride," calling all creation to "bow down, prostrate ourselves, and bend the knee before the L-rd, our Maker."

Each year, Jews repeat this service, crowning G-d as King. This does not negate the world's existence but rather reveals G-d's sovereignty and oneness relating to each creation's particular level.

## The Jew's Dual Nature

Each Jew represents fusion of two opposites:

- Transcends entire creation (through the soul, "truly a part of G-d from above")
- Includes entire creation within himself (as stated: "The world was placed within your hearts")

This is manifest in the human body:

- Body (formed from "dust of the earth") represents connection to worldly existence
- Soul represents transcendence above all limitation
- Combined through G-d's wondrous powers

This fusion within each Jew enables creation of fusion within the world at large.

## Rosh HaShanah Service as Fusion

A Jew's Rosh HaShanah service combines:

- Coronation of G-d as King (self-negation)
- Requests for individual needs (material concerns, health, children, livelihood)

This fusion works because the Jew relates to G-dliness level above both individual existence and transcendence.

## Torah Readings Connection

The holiday Torah readings concern Yitzchok's birth and the Akeidah (binding). The Akeidah represents ultimate self-sacrifice. Though Yitzchok wasn't actually sacrificed, our Sages explain he is considered a perfect burnt offering, with "ashes of Yitzchok" serving as constant merit reminder.

Ashes represent utter nullification of individual existence, yet paradoxically reflect powerful personal existence as they remain a perpetual merit reminder. This duality teaches the service of Rosh HaShanah -- fusing complete self-nullification with personal identity.

## When Rosh HaShanah Falls on Shabbos

Shabbos also combines opposite tendencies: source of blessing for entire week, yet above time, higher than weekdays.

Difference from Rosh HaShanah: Shabbos represents ascent above worldly connection, fundamentally above time (not called "head of week"). Rosh HaShanah is "head of the year," with essential function to source influence for coming days.

When Rosh HaShanah falls on Shabbos, there is added emphasis to fusion of transcendence and worldliness. Shabbos adds dimension to Rosh HaShanah's influence -- notably, the shofar is not sounded, with influence generated by Shabbos itself.

The fusion of Shabbos and Rosh HaShanah reveals influence of level transcending both, with power to join them together. This higher level doesn't negate their individual identities but enhances them.

## The Year 5750 as "Year of Miracles"

The year Tav-Shin-Nun (5750) is designated a "year of miracles." The Hebrew word for miracle also means "uplifted" -- referring to level elevated above natural order.

The intent transcends mere miracle being above nature; rather, "the miracle lifts up the natural order to the extent that the natural order reflects the supernatural." This relates to Shabbos (above nature) influence on Rosh HaShanah (natural order).

## G-d's "Measure for Measure" Principle

To merit the "year of miracles," each Jew must begin miraculous behavioral order -- taking resolutions regarding Torah service, prayer, and kindness that "totally surpass that which could be expected of him based on his behavior in previous years."

This serves as vessel to contain blessings of the year, including the greatest miracle: Messianic redemption.

When "as in the days of your exodus from Egypt, I will show you wonders," G-d will "sound the great shofar for our freedom," bringing Moshiach. His coming is associated with revealing the yechidah (soul essence) of every Jew, when it will be revealed how "Israel and the Holy One, blessed be He, are all one."
