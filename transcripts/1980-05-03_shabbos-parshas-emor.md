## Section 1: Lag BaOmer and R. Shimon bar Yochai

Today is Erev Lag BaOmer. The Alter Rebbe's Siddur notes that during Minchah on Erev Lag BaOmer, no Tachnun is said. On Shabbos, the prayer "Tzidkoscha Tzedek" is also omitted. Hence, we can see that "the celebration of Lag BaOmer begins on the afternoon prior to it."

Lag BaOmer is particularly connected with R. Shimon bar Yochai in two aspects: first, regarding his status as one of R. Akiva's students and second, regarding his own unique characteristics.

The Talmud declares that R. Akiva had 24,000 students who passed away during Sefiras HaOmer because they did not show proper respect towards each other. The plague ended on Lag BaOmer. This presents a difficulty in understanding: The Torah rarely expresses criticism of an individual. Our sages commented, "The Torah did not speak in a derogatory manner even about an impure animal." If so, why does the Talmud teach us about the faults of R. Akiva's students?

### Explanation of the Concept

Each of R. Akiva's students had reached the summit of his particular path of service to G-d. Each had developed a connection to G-d in a unique personal manner, internalizing this path of service so thoroughly that it permeated his entire existence. He could not conceive that another path of service could be correct. Therefore, they did not show proper respect to their colleagues.

The lack of respect came from honesty. On the verse which describes how Joseph's brothers "could not speak peaceably to him," Rashi comments: "From their criticism, we can learn their praise. They did not speak one way with their mouth and another with their heart."

Similarly, R. Akiva's students were so involved with their own path of service, with transcending the limitations of the world and connecting themselves to G-d, that "they could not appreciate the value of another path." They were concerned with their spiritual fulfillment. As such, they turned away from life in the world and hence could not relate to a different path of service.

### Connection to Nadav and Avihu

A similar concept is connected to the service of Aharon's sons, Nadav and Avihu, who died "as they drew close before G-d." Their service represented a high level of devotion, a rung so elevated that it surpassed the level of Moshe and Aharon. Nevertheless, their service was considered a sin because it ignored the elevation and refinement of the world.

Similarly, regarding the service of R. Akiva's students, the Talmud declares: "The world was desolate" -- despite the great heights they had reached in connection to G-d, they had not elevated the world.

### The Survivors

The students of R. Akiva who survived did so because their service placed the emphasis on the refinement of the world. This change is connected with Lag BaOmer because this is when the plague ended.

### R. Shimon bar Yochai's Uniqueness

The above is related to R. Shimon bar Yochai since he belonged to the second category of R. Akiva's students. He himself further emphasized this quality in his own service.

The Talmud relates that after R. Shimon and his son R. Eliezer emerged following their thirteen year ordeal hiding in the cave, R. Eliezer "destroyed" portions of the world because people "forsook eternal life and engaged in temporary life" (they occupied themselves with material affairs rather than the study of Torah).

"Wherever R. Eliezer destroyed, R. Shimon healed." R. Eliezer was on a high spiritual level, as R. Shimon declared: "I have seen superior men (lit. men of ascent) and they are few... if they are two, they are myself and my son." Nevertheless, R. Shimon achieved greater heights: he "healed" (i.e. was involved with the refinement of) the world.

### Partnership in Creation

Through our work in refining the world, we become "G-d's partner in creation." Even though the creation of the world was ex nihilo (something from absolute nothingness), an act that by definition cannot be equaled by the achievements of man, a finite creation, we still have the potential to become full partners in creation.

### R. Shimon's Two Phases

These two types of service also dominated two different periods of R. Shimon bar Yochai's life. During the thirteen years he spent in the cave, he was involved with the transcendence of the material. Even in regard to the performance of Mitzvos, he was forced to perform certain Mitzvos -- e.g. Matzah -- on the spiritual plane and not through actually eating Matzah.

When he left the cave, he proceeded to a higher level: he fulfilled Mitzvos in deed and action. The Talmud Yerushalmi declares that even though "Torah was his profession," R. Shimon stopped studying to construct a Sukkah.

### Erev Lag BaOmer vs. Lag BaOmer

In terms of the above, we can explain the difference between Erev Lag BaOmer and Lag BaOmer itself. Erev Lag BaOmer represents the service of elevation; Lag BaOmer represents the transmission of influence into the world, the service of R. Shimon and the second category of R. Akiva's students.

### Gematria Connection

This concept can be seen in the dates of these occasions. Erev Lag BaOmer falls on the 17th of Iyar. In Gematria (Torah numerology), 17 equals Tov -- good. Lag BaOmer falls on the 18th of Iyar. In Gematria, 18 equals Chai -- life.

The Rebbeim have explained that "Chai Elul (which commemorates the birthday of the Baal Shem Tov and the Alter Rebbe) brings life into the service of Elul." Similarly, Chai Iyar, Lag BaOmer, brings life into the service of Iyar.

## Section 2: Erev Lag BaOmer Falling on Shabbos

The above applies to Erev Lag BaOmer every year. This year, Erev Lag BaOmer falls on Shabbos. All the days of the week are blessed from the preceding Shabbos. This year there is no separation between Lag BaOmer and the Shabbos which blesses it.

In general, one cannot prepare for the activities of the coming week on Shabbos. "Shabbos cannot prepare for a weekday." However, one is allowed to call attention to the needs of the community on Shabbos. (This is particularly true when the event in question occurs on Sunday, and there is no time in between.)

When Lag BaOmer comes directly after Shabbos, it adds to the eagerness with which we would prepare for it. There is a great difference between the excitement about something that will take place directly after the preparation and something that will occur sometime later. Hence, the calling of attention to the needs of Lag BaOmer of this year will be stronger than usual, and this will lead to greater involvement in those activities.

## Section 3: Parshas Emor and Children

There is also a lesson that can be learned from Parshas Emor. This portion has a unique connection with children, as emphasized by our sages' comment on its first verse: "To warn adults regarding children."

There is also a clear connection between Parshas Emor and Lag BaOmer. The Zohar quotes R. Shimon as saying: "I am seeing now what has not been seen by any man from the day Moshe ascended to Mt. Sinai the second time (to receive the second tablets)."

Since Emor is related to Jewish children and also to R. Shimon bar Yochai, it follows that there must be an effort to communicate the teachings of R. Shimon bar Yochai, the inner aspects of Torah, even to children. Through these efforts, the adults will also benefit: "And they that are wise, shall shine as the splendor of the firmament" with this work of yours... through which they will leave this exile with mercy" (Tanya, Iggeres Hakodesh Ch. 26).

## Section 4: Teaching All Children, Including "Children of the World"

Before it was mentioned that children must be connected with the teachings of R. Shimon bar Yochai. The Zohar teaches that in the time before Mashiach's coming: "In the sixth century of the sixth millennium, the portals of wisdom above, and the fountains of wisdom below will be opened."

The inner secrets of Torah will be spread throughout the world, and "even the children of the world" will know "hidden wisdom." R. Shimon was able to communicate the secrets of Torah even to "children of the world" -- i.e., worldly children, those outside the realm of Torah.

### Why Children of the World Must Be Included

This is the reason why lately I have stressed the importance of being involved with children, not only those children that receive a kosher education, but even "children of the world" -- those who are found in the streets.

All four sons -- not only the wise, but also the wicked, the simple, and the one who didn't know -- attended the Seder and furthermore, "the Torah spoke about four sons." The Torah spoke about all four sons of Pesach, confident that afterwards we would continue to work with these children throughout the year.

### The Power of Teaching Torah to Children of the Masses

The involvement with the children of the world is related to the Talmud's statement (B. Metzia 85a): "He who teaches Torah to the son of an 'am ha-aretz,' even if the Holy One, blessed be He, makes a decree, He annuls it for his sake."

Furthermore, when he makes a decree, then "the righteous will decree and G-d will fulfill it." If someone wants his wishes fulfilled, whether they be for his own personal benefit or for that of the entire Jewish people, he should involve himself with the education of the children of 'amai ha-aretz.'

Furthermore, such efforts have the power to save him from suffering, even the suffering of "Chevlai Mashiach." Surely, everyone has already taken part in these activities, but more effort is necessary. This is particularly true regarding the parade that was organized to commemorate the rejoicing of R. Shimon bar Yochai.

### Essay Contest and Parade

There are certain particular points that are relevant to the Lag BaOmer parade. The parade should include "the three pillars on which the world stands: Torah, Avodah (service of G-d) -- which can be performed through the saying of blessings -- and deeds of kindness." It should at least involve the two kinds of service: "Zion will be redeemed by judgment (Torah study) and those who return to her by Tzedakah."

Also, according to the principle, "The jealousy of scribes increase wisdom" (B. Basra 21a), it is proper that an essay contest be held; and for the children to submit their descriptions of the parade and the Torah activities that occurred. Separate contests should be held for boys and for girls.

Everything should have a continued effort. Therefore, it would be appropriate to print the essays in a book. It should be aesthetically pleasing in all aspects. This, in turn, will lead to a greater circulation of the book throughout the world. Understandably, the knowledge that their essays will be printed in a book will further encourage the children to write.

Since we must prepare ourselves for the ingathering of the exiles, it is fitting that each child should write in the language in which he or she can best and most easily communicate his or her feelings. This book should include all the different languages. The order of presentation should be first "the Holy tongue" -- Hebrew. Afterwards, it should include Russian, for Chassidus was born and developed in that country. Next should come English, because today English is the language with which we can reach the most Jewish children. Also it should include Persian, because the Jews of that country are in special need of salvation, and all other languages.

## Section 5: Tangible Reminders and Documentation

The parade should not consist of a "meal" after which the children will depart, but rather they should be given something connected with Torah and Mitzvos that will serve as a reminder of the parade.

The book should also include pictures of the children at the parade. The pictures should be taken in a manner that they will include all the children at the parade and later the child will be able to identify himself in the picture. This will cause more excitement among the children, because everyone, even an adult, is excited when his picture is printed.

Then, later, when the child grows up, he will show his picture to his own grandchildren and explain that it was taken at the celebration of Lag BaOmer, R. Shimon bar Yochai's day of joy. Thus, he will also tell him about R. Shimon.

From the parade of Lag BaOmer and the dancing in this celebration, may we proceed to dance to greet Mashiach, who will bring the true and complete redemption, speedily in our days.
