## Redemption and Freedom

The Rebbe emphasizes that the exodus from Egypt culminated in receiving Torah at Sinai. He states that redemption's purpose was "you will serve G-d on this mountain," connecting physical liberation to spiritual service.

## Dual Service

A central concept discussed is the balance between two dimensions of religious practice: "between man and G-d" and "between man and man." The Rebbe notes that this year's Pesach falls on the third day of the week, traditionally blessed as good "to Heaven and to creatures."

## Unity of Opposites

The letter explains how being "good to creatures" and "good to Heaven" are not separate concerns but interconnected aspects of service. Loving one's fellow Jew serves as a "vessel" for loving the Divine.

## Character Refinement

Torah study and mitzvah observance refine a person's intellect and character, aligning the soul with spirituality.

## Practical Application

The Rebbe encourages celebrating Pesach with both religious observance ("kosher") and joy, including caring for those in need.

The letter concludes with blessings for a meaningful holiday and hints at future redemption through the Messiah.
