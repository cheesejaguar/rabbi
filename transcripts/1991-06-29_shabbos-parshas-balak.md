Today marks the seventeenth of Tammuz. Since this date coincides with Shabbos, the customary fast is deferred to the following day. Two explanatory frameworks exist for this practice:

a) Fasting is prohibited on Shabbos, as sadness has no place on this day. Especially concerning national tragedy commemorations, Shabbos is "a day of joy" and "a delight." Therefore postponement occurs.

b) Deeper interpretation reveals this deferment as a foretaste of the ultimate truth that will emerge during the Redemptive Era when, according to the Rambam, "all the fasts will be nullified... and will be transformed into festivals and days of joy and rejoicing." The Talmudic sage Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi regarding a Tishah BeAv falling on Shabbos stated: "Since it was postponed, it should be nullified entirely."

In microcosm, when a fast coincides with Shabbos, such transformation becomes visible. That date exhibits Shabbos pleasure instead of fasting, displaying two dimensions: negation of undesirable fast elements and emphasis on inner positive nature openly revealed on Shabbos.

Obviously, fast days present undesirable characteristics. Fasting's suffering brings no pleasure. Yet internally, a fast possesses goodness, as scripture declares, "It is a day of will unto G-d."

This contrast manifests regarding the Seventeenth of Tammuz. Outwardly, it associates with negative factors -- Jerusalem's walls breaching, leading to the Temple's destruction. Nevertheless, its inner essential quality proves good. The date itself alludes to this, as 17 numerically equates to a Hebrew term pointing toward exile's intent: guiding Jews toward the Redemptive Era.

Redemption connection also links to Shabbos, which previews "the era which is all Shabbos and rest for eternity." Moreover, Shabbos's mitzvah of material delicacy enjoyment parallels "the feast which the Holy One, blessed be He, will make for the righteous in that future era." Though such feast elements carry spiritual significance, that feast represents an actual physical meal. As Chassidic teaching explains, Redemptive Era's ultimate reward operates not on the spiritual plane -- like souls in Gan Eden without physical form -- but rather within this material world, with souls enclothed in bodies.

Thus when a fast day falls on Shabbos and we fulfill the material delight mitzvah -- indeed, such Shabbos should exceed typical annual Shabbosos in joyfulness, demonstrating sadness has no place -- we experience heightened sensation of the fast day's positive dimension to be experienced during Redemption.

Particularly, this reflects through the Melaveh Malkah meal Saturday night, associated with King David, "the anointed king," and Mashiach's progenitor. Despite the following day's fast, Melaveh Malkah should proceed customarily -- and perhaps with heightened happiness and celebration. This emphasizes the Redemptive Era connection, when the fast transforms into celebration completely and fully.

The Seventeenth of Tammuz's negative dimensions' transformation and their ultimate redemptive-era transformation foretaste connects with this week's Torah portion, Parshas Balak. This portion contains Mashiach allusions, as the Rambam writes:

"The Torah has testified about... the King Mashiach. In the portion of Bilaam mention was made of him, for there prophecy is made concerning two anointed kings. The first anointed king was David, who saved Israel from her enemies and the last anointed king is Mashiach who will arise from his sons and save Israel in the end of days."

By specifying "in the portion of Bilaam," the Rambam alludes to transformation concepts reflected in the verse: "And G-d, your L-rd, did not desire to listen to Bilaam. And G-d your L-rd transformed the curse into a blessing." Similarly, this suggests transformation of fasts into festivals during Redemption. The coming week's Torah portion, Parshas Pinchas, also hints at redemption. First, our Sages identified Pinchas with Eliyahu announcing Redemption. Second, primary subjects all point toward Redemption:

a) Census of the Jewish people -- the final such census occurs during Redemptive Era.

b) Division of Eretz Yisrael -- this portion's description addresses how land was divided. Contrarily, Parshas Matos-Masei's treatment provides greater specificity regarding division among twelve tribes. Thus this week's passage presents more general nature, preparatory for ultimate land division among thirteen tribes during Redemption.

c) Festive sacrifices -- this alludes to fasts transforming into festivals. They will surpass present-era festivals. Our Sages state present-era festivals will be "nullified" during Redemption, while fast days will then celebrate.

Today, the Seventeenth of Tammuz Shabbos, possesses advantage over other Three Week Bein HaMetzarim Shabbosos. These three Shabbosos prepare the cure preceding the malady -- they rectify Bein HaMetzarim's undesirable elements.

Most years, when these Shabbosos fall amid the Three Weeks, negative aspects -- destruction and exile -- prove most prominent. Conversely, in years like this, when the Three Weeks' beginning (Seventeenth of Tammuz) and conclusion (Tishah BeAv) both fall on Shabbos, greater emphasis falls upon this period's positive nature -- that distress serves as preparatory stage for and part of ultimate Redemption.

Thus, other years' Three Week Shabbosos allude to negating this period's undesirable elements. Contrarily, this year's period beginning and conclusion falling on Shabbos alludes to that period's transformation into positive force as realized during Redemption.

Intrinsic relationship exists between this concept and Parshas Balak. Parshas Balak never reads as one of the Three Weeks' parshiyos. Matos, Masei, and Devarim always read during this period, and sometimes Parshas Pinchas also reads. Even when Parshas Balak falls on the Seventeenth of Tammuz as this year, unfavorable Three Week aspects don't commence until Parshas Pinchas's week.

This implies difference between Redemption's connection with Parshas Pinchas versus Parshas Balak. Since Parshas Pinchas falls amid the Three Weeks, its emphasis concerns correcting and compensating for destruction and exile. Contrarily, Parshas Balak addresses Redemption as an independent subject without exile relation -- redemption as it would apply even absent exile.

The present generation receives additional emphasis due to the Previous Rebbe's redemption influence on Yud-Beis Tammuz. Previous generations associated Tammuz with unfavorable events. Contrarily, the Previous Rebbe's redemption connected Tammuz with redemption and happiness. Furthermore, this redemption wasn't individual in nature. As the Previous Rebbe writes:

"The Holy One, blessed be He, did not redeem me alone on Yud-Beis Tammuz. Rather, [the redemption included] all those who hold our holy Torah dear, those who observe its mitzvos, and all those who are called by the name Israel."

Since all redemptions interconnect, his redemption brings us nearer ultimate Redemption. This particularly applies given great achievements in spreading Chassidus wellsprings resulting from that redemption, including Chassidic teachings' center transfer to America, "the lower half of the world."

Per all Sage-mentioned Mashiach coming signs, ours constitutes the final exile generation and initial redemption generation. Therefore, we should regard the Three Week period not as exile-associated, but rather as preparatory stages leading to Mashiach's coming.

Our efforts spreading Chassidus wellsprings have enhanced this. The Previous Rebbe stated all necessary service amounts to "polish the buttons" -- that service has even been accomplished -- and we need only "stand together prepared" greeting Mashiach.

Particularly true in the present year, described as one when "I will show wonders," fulfilling the prophecy "As in the days of your exodus from Egypt, I will show you wonders." We have witnessed wonders indicating -- as mentioned in the Yalkut Shimoni -- this is "the year when the King Mashiach will be revealed" and "the hour when the King Mashiach comes... and announces to the Jewish people, 'Humble ones. The time for your redemption has come.'"

We stand at the Mashiach Era's threshold, Redemption's beginning threshold, and in immediate future, it shall reach completion. In such a year, potential exists not merely for viewing the Three Weeks as Redemption preparation, but for the Redemption itself arriving, even on present Shabbos, thus transforming the Three Weeks into positive period.

Accordingly, greater emphasis must address the custom studying Beis HaMikdash structure laws during these Three Weeks. As G-d told prophet Yechezkel, through this study, it is considered as though we engaged in actual Beis HaMikdash construction.

Additionally, approaching these law studies requires different methodology than previous years. Emphasis must address not mourning the Beis HaMikdash's destruction, but rather desiring and yearning for the Third Beis HaMikdash, regarding which scripture states, "The glory of this later house will surpass the glory of the previous house."

Thus treat the subject as present reality. It's not that distant future will make these laws relevant, but rather at any moment the Third Beis HaMikdash already built in heavens will descend and manifest on earth.

In this context, studying these laws -- like studying Mashiach and Redemption subjects -- shouldn't appear merely as hastening this future era's coming. Rather, it constitutes beginning efforts living with Mashiach concept, to "live with the times," with Mashiach's Era. When these concepts achieve intellectual perception, they will influence our feelings, and ultimately our deeds and actions. Our behavior will suit the present era, a time when we stand at Mashiach's coming threshold.

Although our Sages declared, "Mashiach will come when our attention is diverted," this contradicts no emphasis on studying Mashiach and Redemption subjects. Attention diversion can reference a step transcending our ordinary conscious processes. After deepening one's Mashiach awareness to appreciating we stand on Mashiach's threshold, that all necessary service for his coming has completed, and at any moment he will come, one can transcend ordinary thinking and consider Redemption anew.

These words serve as action directive. Despite recent months' outcries and the present year's witnessed wonders indicating this is "the year when the King Mashiach will be revealed," difficulty exists in having this concept saturate people's consciousness, that they should recognize we actually stand on Redemption's threshold, and should commence living with Mashiach and Redemption concepts.

Although this year brings "I will show you wonders," and wonders have occurred, they haven't manifested completely. Rather, explanation and elaboration regarding witnessed wonders has proven necessary. When G-d Himself shows Jews the wonders completely and manifestly, no explanation proving necessary that we stand on Redemption's threshold will exist. But until that time, these concepts find difficulty making thorough and effective impression on our thought processes.

How transforms this situation? By studying Mashiach and Redemption concepts. The Torah's power -- being G-d's wisdom and His will -- transcends the world and possesses potential changing human character. Thus, although someone feels externally regarding Redemption, through studying these matters, they can commence living with the idea of Mashiach's coming and perceive he comes in the immediate future.

The sixth chapter of Pirkei Avos begins:

"The Sages taught in the language of the Mishnah. Blessed be He who chose them and their teaching. Rabbi Meir declared: 'Whoever occupies himself in [the study of] the Torah for its own sake, merits many things. Furthermore....'"

Points requiring this teaching's clarification include: a) The opening phrase, "The Sages taught in the language of the Mishnah," introduces the chapter overall. It emphasizes that although these teachings weren't included in the Mishnah proper, being a later-added Beraisos collection, they remain "in the language of the Mishnah."

Surface-level, this raises problems. Why add a chapter not part of the Mishnah while composing it in Mishnah's style? b) Teachings' single-unit inclusion isn't chance-based. Thus this introduction's inclusion with Rabbi Meir's teaching indicates shared connection. This connection's nature requires clarification. c) Rabbi Meir lists many particular rewards one receives for Torah study for its own sake in his teaching. So, why preface that teaching with merit of "many things" statement?

These difficulties find resolution as follows: Beraisos constitute teachings transmitted outside Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi's School. Indeed, the very term Beraisa connotes external origin. Nevertheless, they form part of the Torah tradition because "Every new concept developed by an experienced sage was given to Moshe on Mount Sinai."

This reflects the Torah tradition's continuity mentioned at Pirkei Avos's beginning, that "Moshe received the Torah... and transmitted it...." Similarly, in each generation, through "raising up many students," our Torah tradition sustained and perpetuated itself. And in each generation, Torah scholars "taught in the language of the Mishnah," extending our Torah heritage's chain.

Homiletically, the Beraisa concept applies to our current Torah's totality when compared to "the new [dimension of the] Torah that will emerge from Me" during the Redemptive Era. As our Sages taught, "the Torah... of the present era is like wind compared to the Torah [to be revealed by the] Mashiach."

Herein lies Rabbi Meir's teaching's connection. The "many things" he mentions don't reference the particular qualities listed afterwards. Instead, it references the ultimate reward someone receiving for Torah study for its own sake will obtain -- merit to study "the new [dimension of the] Torah that will emerge from Me" during Redemption.

This provides lesson for someone feeling himself "on the outside" regarding Mashiach concept. Through Torah study, he can "merit many things," including state transition. He will no longer remain outside. Rather, he will feel inside, comfortable, with Mashiach concept, and eagerly anticipating receiving "the new [dimension of the Torah] that will emerge from Me."
