5. These remarks continue what was mentioned before (in the Shul) concerning the Mitzvah of lulav and esrog, Simchas Bais HaShoeivah, and the water-offering. Furthermore, they have the advantage of being made in a Sukkah. We are commanded to discuss Torah concepts in every place, as we did in the Shul � but when these remarks are made in a Sukkah, they are actualized in a physical manner.

Among the special influences connected with a Sukkah is that of the Ushpizen, the guests: Avraham, Yitzchok, Yaakov, Moshe, Aharon, Yosef, and Dovid.[43] Also, the Previous Rebbe (Sefer HaMaamarim 5711 p 47) explained that there are �our Ushpizen� the Baal Shem Tov, the Maggid, the Alter Rebbe, the Mitteler Rebbe, the Tzemach Tzedek, the Rebbe Maharash, and the Rebbe Rashab.[44] These influences are brought about through the Sukkah and intensified by the Mitzvah of receiving guests, a Mitzvah which is a vessel for drawing down the influence of the Ushpizen.

Furthermore, a Sukkah is called �a Sukkah of peace� as we say in our prayers �spread over us the Sukkah of Your peace.� Peace must be individual, present in every Jew�s heart. Also, in the simple sense, we must have peace in Eretz Yisrael[45] 1 and then peace in the entire world.

In our prayers we say �Bring us with song to Zion Your city, and with everlasting joy to Yerushalayim Your Sanctuary.� may this become a reality with the coming of Mashiach. He will come and redeem us, �and lead us upright to our land,� gathering �the nation: the men, women, and children,� speedily in our days.
