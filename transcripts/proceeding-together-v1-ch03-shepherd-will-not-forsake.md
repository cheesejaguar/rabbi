The Rebbe quotes his late father-in-law regarding tzaddikim (righteous individuals) who continue to protect the world after their passing. The key passage states: "Not only are they not separated from the flock whose shepherd they have been, but they lovingly present themselves before the footstool of the heavenly throne..."

## Call to Action

The Rebbe emphasizes that followers should strengthen their connection to the Previous Rebbe by:

- Studying his maamarim (chassidic discourses) and sichos (talks)
- Examining his letters carefully
- Contemplating the directives contained within these teachings
- Following the path he established

## Conclusion

The Rebbe expresses commitment to "proceed in the straight path that he has shown us of his paths, and we will walk in his ways forevermore," drawing from the Alter Rebbe's Iggeres HaKodesh.
