# The City of Refuge

**Occasion:** Elul
**Source:** Days of Destiny, Sichos In English

---

Elul serves as a spiritual month of repentance and soul-reckoning before the High Holidays. Unlike daily or weekly spiritual assessments, Elul represents an "overall assessment of the entire business" of one's Torah and mitzvos throughout the year.

## Why Elul is Special

During Elul, "G-d's thirteen attributes of mercy are revealed." This timing prevents despair -- when Jews recognize their spiritual shortcomings, G-d's mercy becomes accessible, helping them develop proper awe and love regardless of their current spiritual state.

## The King in the Field

The Alter Rebbe uses a parable: a king normally requires elaborate protocols to enter his palace, but when the king travels through a field, all people can approach freely. Similarly, Elul represents G-d making Himself accessible to every Jew, "as he is," without special preparation normally required.

## City of Refuge

Elul's name alludes to the Biblical cities of refuge. Just as these cities protected accidental killers from vengeance, Elul provides spiritual sanctuary. A Jew who "exiles himself" from egocentric desires finds atonement through repentance, escaping "unfavorable pronouncements of heavenly justice."

## Three Paths to Elul

The month emphasizes Torah study, prayer, and loving-kindness -- the practices that maintain the world and lead toward spiritual refuge.
