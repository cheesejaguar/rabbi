3. [It is customary for Chassidim to write a Pan (a note asking for the Rebbe�s blessings) before Rosh Hashanah. In addition to these individual requests, the Chassidic community presents the Rebbe Shlita with a general request a Pan Klolli].

May G-d fulfill the wishes of every single Jew everywhere in the world. Particularly in the areas that are mentioned here in these notes (the Pan Klolli), these being the wishes of those who signed (and most probably, the wishes of many others, as well). May they all be completely fulfilled in the near future.

Since this is a year that begins with Shabbos and the nature of Shabbos is, �You shall declare Shabbos a delight,� and �all your work is completed� (and in addition to those activities performed by man � G-d adds more � more than �You shall declare� and more in �the completion of work� �).� May those statements apply to all the matters mentioned here and all of our needs both physical and spiritual.

And may the year be a year of light, a year of blessing, a year of revelation. (Translator�s note: the Hebrew words for light, blessing and redemption begin with the first three letters of the Alef-Bais. And Torah, Tefillah, and Teshuvah begin with the last letter of the Alef-Bais. The Rebbe asked that the blessings that are connected with the other letters also be fulfilled]. A year of Torah, a year of Tefillah (prayer), and a year of Teshuvah. And soon may we merit the coming of Mashiach who will bring Tzaddikim to do Teshuvah and will redeem us and take us walking upright to our land speedily.

May everyone and their families and all connected with them and the entire Jewish people be written down and inscribed for a good and sweet year with open and revealed good.
