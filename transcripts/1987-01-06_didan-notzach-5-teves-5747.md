# In Those Days - In Our Times - Didan Notzach

**Date:** January 6, 1987 (5 Teves, 5747)
**Occasion:** Victory of the Library Court Case (Didan Notzach)
**Source:** Sichos In English, Volume 34

---

On the 5th of Teves 5747, the verdict in the case of the Previous Rebbe's library was handed down and great rejoicing enveloped Chassidim all over the world.

After Minchah on that day the Rebbe Shlita, spoke about the lesson we must learn from the suffering and the pain of undesirable phenomena.

We must increase those areas which were under attack, and we must expand our work of spreading Yiddishkeit and Torah and the wellsprings of Chassidus.

## Learn Torah, Live With Torah

The Previous Rebbe transmitted a teaching of the Alter Rebbe to us, that "We must live with the times." This was expounded by the Mitteler Rebbe, who as the mentor of the younger Chassidim of the Alter Rebbe, explained that in this aphorism the Alter Rebbe was referring to the Torah portion of the week and the study section of that specific day of the week. The daily Torah portion should be learned in a way that we can live with its message.

Being Tuesday, today's study portion of Vayigash will have the added quality of the double blessing "Ki-Tov" (that it was good), which the Gemara tells us indicates "good to heaven and good to man." This of course does not mean that part of the day shall be devoted to "heaven" and another part to "man," rather, that every moment, and each action, speech and thought of the day -- should have both aspects -- goodness for heaven and goodness for man.

## Yosef's Odyssey -- A Mission From G-d

In the first verse of today's portion Yosef assured his brothers:

Now it is not you who sent me here but G-d (Elokim). (Bereishis 45:8)

Yosef wanted them to know that although his descent to Egypt had caused him much suffering, he nevertheless realized that his being in Egypt was a mission of G-d. From this explanation we learn that when a Jew is in an unfavorable situation, even after extricating himself from that painful condition, he must explain to others, and certainly to himself, that the troublesome state was not a mere coincidence, and most importantly, it was not something caused by man! He should also not carry with him the bad memories of the suffering he endured.

Now, if in the story of Yosef he relates that: "It is not you who sent me here but G-d (Elokim)," then, we, too, must realize now, that when a Jew finds himself in any condition -- good or bad -- he must recognize that he has been given a mission to fulfill -- and not one delineated by man, but by G-d.

## But Why Suffering?

You may wonder that this same development could have been effected by G-d in a revealed and a merciful way? However, here it had to go through the garment of Elokim -- severity! Because it stems from an aspect that is sequestered, it adds another level of descent, and ultimately it will attain a greater degree of elevation.

Every Jew must know, that no matter where he is and no matter what condition he is in, he has a Shlichus -- a mission -- which may be clothed in a situation that hides and conceals. Nevertheless, it is still clear that it must come into action.

## Every Step Is Guided

The previous Rebbe explained the teaching of the Baal Shem Tov, on the verse: "Man's footsteps are guided by G-d" (Tehillim 37:23). That no matter where a person goes, he must cause the Name of G-d to be revealed in the world. Wherever you go it is by Divine Providence and you must make there a habitation for G-d's Name, as in the Tabernacle and Holy Temple.

You must start by making your own home a place for the Shechinah to dwell, and then go out to the outside of your doorways, as we just learned from the holiday of Chanukah.

## Convert Evil, Increase Holiness

Chassidus explains the term "Tarmodoians" as the forces which oppose G-dliness. When they cease to exist they are converted and uplifted, causing an increase in G-dliness.

In dealing with our responsibility to increase our efforts, how do we know where the special emphasis must be placed? For this we have the advice: "From my enemies I am wiser" (Tehillim 119:98).

In the story of the liberation of the Alter Rebbe from Czarist incarceration we were told that based on the charges brought against him, he later learned where, and in what areas, it was necessary to increase his efforts.

## "To Whom Does This Belong?"

To reach the greater heights there had to be opposition presented in the guise of an attack! What was said? That Agudas Chassidei Chabad are not active; and we are not using the manuscripts and studying the books and the words of the living G-d; and that the activities of spreading Yiddishkeit to the outside are not being done.

Really nothing was lacking but the "polishing of the buttons." Remember, buttons only connect the sides of the garment -- the right and left sides would be apart without the buttons. The buttons unify the two halfs. But the buttons had only to be polished. Why all these problems?

The answer is that we must do even more! We must be filled with great joy which bursts all limitations and nullifies all restrictions and measure. This joy must infuse our action and influence all that we do.

## Ya'akov Lives! Because We Live!

For the Gemara had stated about Ya'akov: "Ya'akov our Patriarch is not dead...As his seed will be alive, so he too will be alive." (Ta'anis 5b)

When each of us is alive, tied to the living Torah and its mitzvos, of which it says: "You shall truly live by keeping them" (Vayikra 18:5), then the spirit of Ya'akov comes alive.

## Your Home -- A Chabad House

Starting from this Tuesday, and with these verses of Torah, make your own home a Chabad House -- and then influence all the Jews in the field, likewise. The nations of the world recognize the power of Yosef the ruler of Mitzrayim, and this will influence their observance of the Seven Noachide Laws.

Simply put, today, do more tzedakah, give money to the poor and also help Jews in every way. Disseminate these words; start today this mission of spreading Torah and good deeds in an ever-increasing way -- down to earth -- to complete the ultimate goal and that which is temporarily negative will reach the true and ultimate perfection, to create a dwelling place for G-d in the lower worlds, in the last moments of golus. This goodness must be increased -- with joy and glad hearts -- soon and in our days -- may this all be in reality and may the reward be greater than the pain, as a true find -- the coming of Moshiach -- in our time Amen, so may it be!
