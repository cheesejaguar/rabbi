The unique qualities of the present year are reflected in the signs mentioned by the Sages of our people in regard to the days on which Rosh HaShanah is celebrated. Among them:

1. The phrase from Daniel 1:5 meaning "the king's food" is interpreted as follows: When HaMelech, i.e., Rosh HaShanah, falls on either of the second or the third day of the week, then the parshiyos, Nitzavim and Vayeilech are divided. Nitzavim is read on the Shabbos before Rosh HaShanah and Vayeilech, on the Shabbos afterwards.

2. If Rosh HaShanah falls on the second day as it does this year, then the year will be shleimah, "full," i.e., both the months of MarCheshvan and Kislev will have thirty days. Also, in such a year, Pesach falls on Shabbos, the seventh day of the week.

Thus the present year contains three different states of perfection:

1. In regard to the months of the year -- This is a leap year, when a thirteenth month is added. Our Sages described a leap year as a perfect year, implying that the addition of the extra month contributes a dimension of perfection to the year as a whole.

2. In regard to weeks -- On the verse, "And they shall be seven perfect weeks for you," the Midrash relates that the weeks of the Counting of the Omer are "perfect" when, each week, the counting of the Omer begins on the first day of the calendar week and thus, the conclusion of each week of the Counting of the Omer is on Shabbos.

3. In regard to days -- Every year, there are two months (MarCheshvan and Kislev) whose number of days varies. This year, both those months are complete, each including thirty days. Thus, this year contains the maximum amount of days possible.

The above concepts and similarly, the allusions associated with the Hebrew letters equivalent to the year's number, 5752, are all significant and are worthy of elaboration.

There is a thematic connection between Rosh HaShanah and Sunday, the first day of the week, for both commemorate the creation of the world. Since Rosh HaShanah can never fall on Sunday, when it falls on a Monday as in the present year, there is a closer interrelation to this concept.

To elaborate on this connection: The Torah refers to the first day of creation, not as the first day, but as "one day," a day in which "the Holy One, blessed be He, was one with His world." Although all the different creations had already come into being, they were permeated with G-d's oneness and did not sense their individual identity.

The creation of man was intended to bring the world to a similar state of oneness. And indeed, this goal was realized by Adam, the first man, directly after his creation. For he called to all the other created beings, telling them "Come let us prostrate ourselves, bow, and bend the knee before G-d, our Maker."

Thus our Sages explain that at this time, Adam crowned G-d as King of the world. Similarly, each Rosh HaShanah, man must relive this initial experience and accept G-d as King. In doing so, man -- as did Adam -- elevates the creation as a whole to a higher level.

To explain: The Torah concludes the narrative of the creation with the phrase "everything which G-d created laasos." Our Sages explain that laasos should be interpreted to mean "to correct," i.e., G-d created the world in such a manner that man can -- and indeed is expected to -- enhance the creation through his service of Torah and mitzvos.

At the beginning of creation, the world was brought into being in a complete and perfect state. This perfection, however, was within the limits of the natural order. Through the service of Torah and mitzvos, man has the potential of transforming the world into a dwelling for G-d, a place where His essence is manifest. This reveals a level of perfection which transcends the natural order.

This concept is reflected in the Torah's description of man's creation: "And G-d, the L-rd, formed man [from] dust from the earth and He blew into his nostrils a living soul." Man was formed from dust, for dust is the foundation of the entire creation, "everything comes from dust." This grants him the potential to infuse the influence of the "living soul" into the entire creation, allowing the revelation of the G-dly power which brings the world into being. Furthermore, as mentioned above, man can reveal a level of G-dliness which transcends the natural order.

When Rosh HaShanah falls on Monday and Tuesday, we see a unique progression. From Sunday, "a day of oneness," we proceed to the two days of Rosh HaShanah which represent the state of completion which man can add to the natural order. Significantly, these days fall on Monday and Tuesday. Our Sages explain the significance of these days, noting that on Monday, division was created and on Tuesday, division was nullified and peace established.

Division is a result of the concealment of G-dliness which characterizes our world. The first day represents G-d's conception of the world. In contrast, the second day reflects a transition to man's perspective and from man's perspective, the world is characterized by division. The third day represents the conclusion of the process, the revelation of how, even from man's perspective, the division can be resolved and the environment can be characterized by peace.

This transition is accomplished through the service of man and his observance of the Torah as the Rambam writes, "The Torah was given only to establish peace within the world." Through the Torah, the Jews reveal a third perspective which reconciles G-d's perspective of the world and that of man. For this reason, the Torah and the Jewish people are also connected to the concept of three. Thus our Sages relate in regard to the giving of the Torah, that G-d "gave a threefold light to a threefold people in the third month."

In this context, we can comprehend the relationship to the Parshiyos Nitzavim and Vayeilech. Nitzavim represents the essential stance of the Jewish people. This is amplified by Parshas Vayeilech which describes the level of perfection reached by Moshe on the day of his death. Every Jew shares a connection to this level, for each Jew possesses a spark of Moshe within him.

Vayeilech means "And he went," referring to the progress reached by the Jews in their service in this world. When, as in the present year, the two Torah portions are divided, the distinction between the level of the Jews before their service in this world and the level reached after their service is accentuated.

The above concepts receive greater influence in the present year, 5752, a year which is described as Shnas niflaos bah, "a year which will contain wonders," and these wonders will be bakol, "in all things," i.e., every aspect of the year will be characterized by wonders. Furthermore, these wonders will be revealed in a manner of binah, "understanding."

Wonders are associated with the coming of the Redemption as the verse states, "As in the days of your exodus from Egypt, I will show you wonders." "I will show you" refers to the revelation of the positive nature of our service in bringing the world to a higher level of perfection.

The expression bakol mikol kol is numerically equivalent to the word kabetz, meaning "gather." Thus it serves as a reference to the ingathering of the exiles which will take place during the Era of the Redemption. May G-d soon "Sound the great shofar for our freedom and raise a banner to gather our dispersed."

May the Redemption come immediately, indeed, may it be that it has already come. For the newspapers have already written about Mashiach's coming -- may they continue to write more and may these articles be in the past tense for Mashiach's coming will already be a reality.
