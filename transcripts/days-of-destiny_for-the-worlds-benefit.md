# For the World's Benefit

**Occasion:** Lag BaOmer
**Source:** Days of Destiny, Sichos In English

Lag BaOmer, the thirty-third day of the Omer, is celebrated for two principal reasons:

First, Rabbi Akiva's twenty-four thousand disciples all died because they failed to show proper respect and honor to each other. This tragedy ended on Lag BaOmer, establishing it as a joyous festival.

Second, Lag BaOmer marks the Yartzeit (anniversary of passing) of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai (Rashbi), author of the Zohar and foremost sage of his time. Yartzeit celebrations are joyous occasions because in Judaism, the soul is primary and true life consists of Torah and mitzvos -- service to G-d that is eternal.

## The Core Teaching

The text explains that Rashbi's disciples of Rabbi Akiva who survived had a different approach than those who perished. The twenty-four thousand died because their service to G-d, while rooted in the ideal of mesirus nefesh (self-sacrifice), remained trapped in personal spiritual yearning for G-d.

"Although ecstatic yearning for G-d is a lofty ideal, the ultimate service of a Jew is to introduce G-dliness into the world."

The five surviving disciples, including Rashbi, directed their mesirus nefesh toward improving the world. They "revived the Torah at that time" by ensuring their spiritual achievements benefited others, not merely themselves.

## Rashbi's Model

Rashbi exemplified this balance. Despite being a supreme mystic whose entire life was Torah, completely absorbed in divine contemplation, he actively sought to help others upon leaving his thirteen-year cave refuge. When his son R. Elazar destroyed through his spiritual intensity, "wherever R. Elazar destroyed, Rabbi Shimon healed."

Rashbi taught that "the crown of a good name surpasses them all" because it represents achievement through benefiting others. His greatest act occurred on Lag BaOmer itself when he revealed "holy words that were unrevealed until then," taking previously hidden mystical knowledge and sharing it publicly.

## The Practical Application

The teaching concludes by encouraging emulation of Rashbi's example: studying Torah with complete focus, performing mitzvos to establish bonds with G-d, and disseminating Torah to introduce G-dliness into the world. This three-fold approach mirrors how Rashbi unified revealed Torah, hidden Torah, and worldly concerns into one integrated service.
