The physician of the Rebbe [Rayatz] once said of himself that in reference to the Rebbe, he was of no account as a physician. As a physician he was unable to understand the Rebbe's material life.

The truth is, that "the Rebbe's life is spiritual life" -- "the life of a *tzaddik* is not a fleshly life, but a spiritual life."

From this it is apparent that as far as the Rebbe is concerned, there is no difference between the previous situation and the present situation. Now, too, the Rebbe is with us *begashmiyus.*

The Rebbe [Rayatz] used to say: "A bond with me *(hiskashrus)* is made by studying my *maamarim* of *Chassidus,* by fulfilling my request concerning the daily recital of *Tehillim,* and the like."

These words of the Rebbe [Rayatz], concerning *hiskashrus* with him, still apply today.
