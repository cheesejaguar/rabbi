## Story of the Rebbe Rashab

The Rebbe Rashab, as a young boy on his 4th or 5th birthday, was brought to his grandfather the Tzemach Tzedek for a blessing. Upon entering, he wept and asked: "In cheder, we learned that G-d revealed Himself to Avraham. Why does He not reveal Himself to me?"

The Tzemach Tzedek responded that "When a Jew who is ninety-nine years old recognizes that he must undergo circumcision, he is worthy of having G-d reveal Himself to him."

## Core Teaching on Circumcision

The mitzvah of circumcision represents removing the orlah (foreskin), an impure manifestation that obscures divine revelation. Even at the highest levels of spiritual achievement, represented by Abraham's 99 years, one must recognize the need for further elevation to access complete divine revelation. The goal transcends self-perfection and focuses on achieving G-dly revelation.

## Connection to Redemption

All spiritual service aims toward revealing G-dliness in the world. Until this revelation manifests, the ultimate goal remains incomplete. This concept connects directly to bringing about Geulah (redemption).

## Moshiach and Personal Service

Each Jew contains a spark of Moshiach that must be revealed through consciousness, action, and worldly influence. This constitutes personal redemption. Collectively, individual redemptions combine to create complete Geulah. Jews serve as shluchim (agents), utilizing all ten soul powers -- three intellectual, three emotional, four active -- primarily through learning and spreading Chassidic teachings.

## Current Stage

The Rebbe indicates that obstacles to revelation have been removed. Former opposition from those denying G-d or doubting Moshiach has effectively ceased. The current phase calls for arousing yearning for divine revelation and removing subtle obscurations, similar to Avraham's circumcision at 99 years old.

## Conclusion

Through intensified study of Chassidus, fulfilling shlichus with complete soul commitment, and cultivating genuine desire for G-dly revelation, redemption can materialize immediately.
