Three times a day, facing in the direction of the ruins of the Bais HaMikdash, Jews throughout the generations have prayed for Mashiach�s (Messiah�s) coming. Today, in the twentieth century, Jewish children have not forsaken the ancient path of their fathers. Desp the mistaken opposition from some quarters, they continue to affirm their hope through singing the song �We want Mashiach now.� At addresses on the first day of Chanukah (to children), Shabbos Chanukah, and Zos Chanukah, 5741, the Lubavitcher Rebbe Shlita explained why their song is indeed the authentic expression of Jewish faith.
