## 1. The Problematic Prohibition of Interest

This week's Torah reading addresses the prohibition of giving and taking interest, concluding: "I am the L-rd your G-d Who brought you out of the land of Egypt... to be your G-d." The Sifra comments that whoever accepts the prohibition of interest accepts the yoke of heaven, while whoever rejects it rejects the yoke of heaven.

This raises a fundamental question: Why should the prohibition of interest be uniquely connected to the Exodus and acceptance of divine sovereignty?

## 2. Who is Steering Whom?

The acceptance of heaven's yoke finds expression through fulfilling commandments. Divine fulfillment of commandments takes two forms: First, divine fulfillment preceding Jewish fulfillment. Second, divine fulfillment generated by Jewish fulfillment, as the Sages teach: "Whoever reads the Torah, the Holy One, Blessed be He, reads and repeats in step with him."

## 3. Rewards Honestly Earned

Chassidus explains that divine benevolence constitutes true good only when earned. Unearned gifts are called "bread of shame." G-d therefore established an order where Jewish service produces effects above. This way, reward cannot be called "bread of shame": since service serves useful purpose above, the Jewish people deserve reward.

## 4. Productive Labor

Work lacking intrinsic usefulness becomes burdensome and tiring. The previous Rebbe illustrated this by describing a landowner who ordered a peasant to mime harvesting in thin air. Though promised payment, the peasant soon begged for relief, saying "I've got nothing to show for it."

This is why G-d ordained that Jewish labor produces effects above. A Jew finds strength when sensing divine service affects G-d's Essence and Being.

## 5. Taking G-d as a Partner

Receiving interest means profiting from money lent, gaining from the fact that money was previously the lender's. One who transgresses the interest prohibition -- profiting now from past lending -- receives corresponding treatment from above. One observing the interest commandment receives reciprocal treatment: not only initial strength, but ongoing divine participation during service itself.

This connects the interest commandment to accepting heaven's yoke and the Exodus.

## 6. "Tzaddikim Resemble Their Creator"

Not only do righteous leaders give emissaries strength for missions, but they themselves engage in identical service. They shouldn't be satisfied merely raising disciples engaged in Torah and Chassidus dissemination. Such reasoning -- profiting from past endeavors -- amounts to taking interest. Rather, such individuals should constantly engage with others' needs.

## 7-8. Tithing with Integrity and Accepting One's Appointed Tasks

The Torah determined both original and replacement animals become consecrated because "the Torah plumbed the underlying thoughts of man and something of his Evil Inclination."

A person might prefer engaging in superior avodah than what's demanded. The response is Torah's statement: "One may not discriminate between good and bad, nor may one substitute" -- one cannot even exchange bad for good.

## 9. Taking the Rebbe's Advice

A Californian timber dealer once visited the previous Rebbe for yechidus. After business questions, he asked about children's education, but disliked the Rebbe's directive.

The Rebbe responded: "Consider. Regarding timber, which I've never engaged in, you traveled distance asking advice. Yet regarding children's education -- my actual occupation and my forebears' -- you don't accept my advice?"

## 10. Pious Rationalizations

The Sages teach: "This is how the Evil Inclination plies his craft. Today he tells a man 'do this,' and tomorrow 'do that' -- until one day he tells him 'serve idols!'"

The previous Rebbe explained: The Evil Inclination doesn't approach saying "sin" directly. Instead, finding someone studying Torah, he says "do this!" meaning "I agree you should study Torah because your study is so precious G-d Himself delights in it." Once the Yetzer HaRa approves service for ego-reasons, he advances until eventually saying "serve!"

Coping requires fulfilling appointed missions without calculations, in self-effacement and unquestioning acceptance.

## 11-12. Holy Letters / It Takes One Minute

R. David Zvi Chein taught his grandson Mishnayos. When the grandson didn't grasp an explanation, R. David Zvi consoled him: "These are holy letters."

When the previous Rebbe left Vienna, someone checked his precise watch and told the Rebbe: "One minute left!" The Rebbe replied: "So there's still time to do teshuvah."
