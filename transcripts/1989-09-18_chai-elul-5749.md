As mentioned on the previous nights, these days should be used to make Chassidic farbrengens. They are days of happiness associated with the wedding of the Previous Rebbe on the thirteenth of Elul and that of his father, the Rebbe Rashab on the eleventh of Elul. The happiness of the day is further expressed by the fact that today is the birthday of the Baal Shem Tov and the Alter Rebbe.

Just as the date combines two birthdays, this week is associated with the reading of two portions in the Torah, Nitzavim and Vayeilech. The combination of these two portions produces a lesson for us in the service of G-d.

There are two general paths of service: a) to strengthen one's existing level (Nitzavim -- "standing"); b) to seek to grow and proceed from one level to another (Vayeilech -- "And he went").

Seemingly, these paths are contradictory: In the first path, one's intent is to firmly establish one's position, attaining the strength of a king. "A king's word uproots mountains," i.e., one has the potential to negate any obstacles or difficulties. In contrast, in the second path, one is continuously seeking to leave one's present level and proceed to a different and higher rung.

Generally, we find that the first path of service (Nitzavim) is followed first. After one has firmly established one's position, one has the potential to grow and reach higher peaks. There are, however, times when both paths are combined (as on the present Shabbos when the two portions are read together). One has the ability to stand firmly and powerfully in one's own position and simultaneously, proceed to further heights.

In this manner, each service reinforces the other. The ability to grow contributes to the strength of one's position and one's personal fortitude produces a greater potential for growth. The cycle continues giving one the potential to continuously reach higher levels in both services.

This concept is also related to the Messianic Era. On one hand, then we will experience the ultimate potential to "proceed from strength to strength" and simultaneously, this will be in a manner of "the righteous will dwell in Your presence;" i.e., they will be able to internalize the revelation and appreciate it in a settled manner.

May we merit those revelations now. Without waiting for tomorrow or even for midnight to come, may we merit the coming of Mashiach. Thus, from the seven days of celebration for the Previous Rebbe's wedding, we will proceed to the Messianic Age which represents the ultimate wedding, the bond between G-d and the Jewish people.
