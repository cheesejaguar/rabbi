This talk was given during the annual Kinus Hashluchim (gathering of emissaries) in 5752 (1991). The Rebbe emphasizes that the foundation and task of shluchim in the current generation must be addressed, particularly highlighting a new element: "to greet Moshiach Tzidkeinu in the true and complete Geuloh."

## Key Themes

The Rebbe explains that periodically new elements are added to the work of shlichus, with each becoming "the gate through which all the other elements ascend." In this generation, "the special shlichus of our time: to greet Moshiach Tzidkeinu" holds primary importance.

## Definition of Shliach

The Rebbe discusses what constitutes a shliach according to Jewish law and explains that every Jew serves as a shliach of the Holy One to transform the world into a dwelling place through Torah and Mitzvos. The parsha of Chayei Sara emphasizes this concept through Eliezer's role as Avraham's emissary in arranging the match between Rivka and Yitzchok.

## Central Message

"From this it is understood, that the only thing which now remains in the avodah of the shlichus is: to greet Moshiach Tzidkeinu in actuality."

## The Paradox

Despite completion of teshuvah and all spiritual work, Geuloh has not yet arrived. The Rebbe teaches that in each generation, an individual is fit to be Moshiach, and "when the time comes, G-d will reveal Himself to him and send him."

## Required Action

The conference's primary task is making a public statement that the generation's objective is preparing to accept Moshiach. Every shliach should explain these concepts to people in their respective cities, conveying "the imminence of Moshiach's coming and the need to study about Moshiach and the Era of the Redemption."

## Key Insight

Not only are people dependent on Moshiach, but Moshiach depends on recognition and acceptance from the people. Without people recognizing and accepting his leadership, he cannot lead them from exile.

## Path Forward

The Rebbe emphasizes that learning and teaching about these concepts is the direct way to bring Geuloh. He specifically mentions that making a resolution to study Torah Ohr and Likkutei Torah of the Alter Rebbe accelerates this process, as understanding Moshiach and Geuloh enables recognition of the Moshiach.

## Conclusion

"What are we waiting for?!"
