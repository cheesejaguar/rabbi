*As a means to unity, Jews should study Rambam's magnum opus, Mishneh Torah, daily.*

Unity among Jews is such an important matter that all efforts must be undertaken to achieve it. Indeed, unity hastens the final redemption: The cause of the exile, our sages say, was baseless hatred among Jews. When love and unity reign among Jews, the cause of the exile will have been abolished -- and thus automatically the exile itself will be ended.

## Unity Through Torah

One of the ways to promote unity is for all Jews to learn the same subject in Torah. When a Jew studies Torah he and Torah are joined in "a wonderful union, like which there is none other." When a number of Jews study the same topic, they too, through the Torah they study, are united in "a wonderful union, like which there is none other." And because Torah is eternal, the bond forged between Jews through Torah is also eternal.

This unity is in addition to the warmth and closeness among those who learn a common subject when they together discuss and analyze its ideas.

The unity of Jews through Torah could be produced by learning any topic. But since "Israel is linked to the Torah" -- meaning every aspect of a Jew and Jewry is connected to Torah in its entirety -- the ultimate unity is produced by learning something which encompasses the whole Torah.

## Rambam's Mishneh Torah

There is a work which does just that. Rambam (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon -- Maimonides) wrote a work which, he writes in his Introduction to it, is a "compendium of the entire Oral Torah." He called this work "Mishneh Torah" -- "Repetition of the Torah" -- for "a person who first reads the Written Torah and then this work will know from it the whole of the Oral Torah." And, he writes, it is written "in plain language and terse style" so that the entire Oral Torah might become systematically known to all.

Besides serving as an instrument wherewith to unite all Jewry, there is another important advantage to learning Mishneh Torah -- concerning the mitzvah of studying Torah, in which there are various levels:

1) "Study which leads to deed; they are the laws which every person needs to know to observe the mitzvos properly."

2) "To know all the Written Torah and the whole Oral Torah," which includes all the Talmud Bavli and Yerushalmi, Mechilta, Sifra, Sifri, Tosafos and all the Midrashim.

3) There is a special advantage to learning the laws of the Torah, including those which are unnecessary for observance of the mitzvos (such as those which do not apply in exile).

4) Study specially to engrave the words of Torah in one's memory.

In the third level, study of the halachos in Torah, Mishneh Torah is unique. Unlike other halachic works (e.g. Rif and Shulchan Aruch) which omit certain laws, such as those which do not apply in exile, Rambam's Mishneh Torah explains all the halachos in Torah. When, therefore, a person learns Mishneh Torah, he fulfills the mitzvah of studying and knowing all the Torah's laws.

## Apportionment of Mishneh Torah

In light of the above, the following proposal is offered:

In addition to one's regular study sessions in Talmud, in the laws necessary for proper observance of mitzvos, and in other subjects in Torah, every person should learn Mishneh Torah daily. Mishneh Torah should be apportioned into sections, a different section to be learned each day. Thus, each day all Jews will learn the one and the same section.

Study should begin on Sunday, the twenty-seventh of Nissan. Study of Mishneh Torah should follow the order arranged by the Rambam himself. Thus, study should begin with the Introduction, followed by the enumeration of the mitzvos and the listing of the mitzvos grouped in the order in which they are presented in Mishneh Torah. This should be done in the first four days. Thereafter, three chapters a day should be learned. According to this arrangement, the study of Mishneh Torah will be concluded on erev Pesach, the birthday of the Rambam.

Those who are unable to learn three chapters a day should learn a chapter a day.

## Sefer HaMitzvos

Because one of the principal goals of learning Rambam is to unite all Jews, women and children should also participate. Children -- both in years or in knowledge -- although unable to learn Mishneh Torah, should participate by learning a work similar to Mishneh Torah, also authored by the Rambam -- Sefer HaMitzvos (The Book of Mitzvos).

In his Introduction to Sefer HaMitzvos, Rambam writes that it serves as an "opening" and "introduction" to the Mishneh Torah. In it Rambam enumerates and briefly explains the six hundred and thirteen mitzvos which are explained at length and in detail in Mishneh Torah.

So that all those who study Rambam -- both those learning Mishneh Torah and those learning Sefer HaMitzvos -- should be united together, the study of Sefer HaMitzvos should correspond to the study of Mishneh Torah.

## Participation of all Jews

Since one of the principal elements in the study of Rambam is the unification of Jewry, as many Jews as possible, men, women and children, should participate.

Those who first participate after the study of Rambam has already begun, should start learning the daily portion which the others are learning, and should learn the missed earlier portions at another time.

May it be G-d's will that the unity of Jews engendered through the study of Rambam hasten the true and complete redemption. May we speedily merit the fulfillment of the promise with which Rambam concludes Mishneh Torah: "The whole world will be occupied only in knowing the L-rd, and all Israel will therefore be great sages, knowing the hidden matters and comprehending knowledge of their Creator as much as man is capable of, as it is said: 'For the earth will be full of knowledge of the L-rd as the waters cover the sea.'"
