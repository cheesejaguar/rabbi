## 1. Connection Between First and Last Days of Pesach

We find ourselves on the eve of the last days (7th & 8th) of Pesach, which come as a continuation to the eve of the first days of Pesach.

It is understood that the remarks that were made concerning the first days (on the eve of the 14th) should be mentioned again and reinforced.

In general the remarks were: that we -- through our action -- should see to it that this Pesach be a Kosher and Freilacha one, and that its effects should continue throughout the year -- that the year be a Kosher and Freilacha one. These ideas have further connection to the _last_ days of Pesach.

It is explained (Sefer Hasichos 5700 p. 72) that during the first days of Pesach the emphasis is on the redemption from Mitzrayim, while during the last days of Pesach the emphasis is on the future redemption, as understood from the Torah reading and the Haftorah of the last days. The Torah reading for the seventh day of Pesach begins: "Then Moshe will sing."

The Talmud (Sanhedrin 91b) comments that this is an allusion to the resurrection of the dead. Similarly, the last verses of "Oz Yashir," "the sanctuary which Your hands, O L-rd, have established," refer primarily to the third Bais HaMikdash which will be built by G-d (note Rashi on verse). Then, "the L-rd will reign forever and ever;" a redemption which will not be followed by any exile.

These two redemptions are alluded to in the verse (Bereishis 46:4), "And I will also surely bring you up again." ("I will bring you up" refers to the redemption from Mitzrayim; "Again" refers to the future redemption.)

Between the first and the final redemption there is a long time lapse, in order that the future redemption occur in a manner of perfection and completeness through the Jews' using that time for Torah and Mitzvos.

Just as it was through the merit of "You shall serve G-d on this mountain" that brought about the redemption from Mitzrayim (note Rashi Shemos 3:12), through the guarding of the Torah -- of "Moshe My servant," who was the first redeemer and will be the last redeemer (Shemos Rabbah 2:4) -- and the fulfillment of Mitzvos we will merit to go out of Galus through Mashiach Tzidkeinu.

The above gives more encouragement and motivation to do, from now on, that was outlined on the eve of the first days of Pesach with "the excellence of dignity, and the excellence of power." There still remain the last days of Pesach that also should be Kosher and Freilacha ones, and that these days of Pesach should be continued throughout the whole year -- to the point that we mention the exodus from Egypt twice every day, in the morning and in the evening.

The power, encouragement, and strength to bring about that the whole year be a "year of Pesach" is taken from all the days of Pesach, and in particular from the last days of Pesach, for "everything goes after the end."

## 2. Children and the Seventh Day of Pesach

The main emphasis (of all the above) is on those children before Bar Mitzvah and Bas Mitzvah age, about whom we say, "They recognized first" (Sotah 11b, Shemos Rabbah 1:12); as mentioned in the previous farbrengens at length.

This concept of "They recognized Him first" is openly seen on the seventh day of Pesach. For then the Torah reading contains the verse, "This is my G-d and I will glorify Him," which is the verse upon which our sages commented, "They recognized Him first."

It is therefore the request of all Jewish children that they know that the seventh day of Pesach is _their_ special day. All children before Bar Mitzvah and Bas Mitzvah age -- "a voice not tainted by sin" -- in all times and places are those of whom the Torah testifies, "They recognized Him first."

These children should encourage and strengthen their parents so that in their (the parents') lives "And He will return the hearts of parents through the children" should be a reality to a greater degree than has been the case until now.

Together with giving their parents the due honor and respect, they have to know that "all of you (the children and the parents) must honor and fear G-d;" and that G-d says that the true honor given to the parents consists of the children helping the parents as much as possible.

There is a special blessing from G-d for honoring one's parents (not found in any of the other ten commandments). The blessing applies even to adults who honor their parents and even more so to the children "whose voice is not tainted by sin." Included within the blessing is that they should have success in influencing their parents -- with more success than older children have in that field. Influencing the parents will be done with even more success in the day preceding the "Shira" when (they said for the first time at the Red Sea, and) we say, "This is my G-d and I will glorify Him" -- with the children recognizing Him first.

This brings about "the L-rd will reign forever and ever" and "Deliverers will go up to Mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau, and kingship will be the L-rd's," which refers to Mashiach, may he come and redeem us and take us upright to our land.

## 3. Lesson from Today's Torah Reading

Everything must be connected with actual deed, and in accordance with the saying of the Alter Rebbe of living with the times, by taking a lesson from today's Torah reading.

The Torah reading begins, "Let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season" -- Pesach Rishon.

The strength to perform the first Pesach offering came from a commandment of G-d. However, there were people who were impure or far away (in exile) who couldn't bring the Pesach sacrifice in its time. They went and complained to Moshe: "Wherefore are we to be kept back, not to bring the offering of the L-rd in its appointed time among the children of Israel?" It was this complaint that immediately brought about the command from G-d, "Yet you shall keep -- not only a command to keep, but also an assurance from G-d that you will keep -- the Passover unto the L-rd, in the second month on the 14th day (Pesach Sheni)."

Through the service of Jews they uplift and purify matters that are found to be very low -- below holiness -- to the degree "that purposeful sins become (like) merits," the advantage of a Baal Teshuvah.

The connection between Pesach Sheni and (the eve of) the seventh day of Pesach is as follows:

Through the Jews demanding, "Wherefore are we to be kept back" they receive the strength and assurance from above to elevate the lowest matters (Chametz) to the highest matters, to G-d Himself just as by the splitting of the Red Sea where the Jews saw G-d Himself and pointed with a finger and said "This is my G-d and I will glorify Him."

And all Jews will scream and demand "wherefore are we to be kept back from bringing the offering to the L-rd" -- we want to have the third Bais HaMikdash and sacrifice there "the offering of the L-rd." And this complaint will bring about that very soon there will come about "rejoicing in the rebuilding of Your city and glad in Your service, and there we will partake of the sacrifices and the Passover-offerings."

## 4. Children's Gatherings on the Seventh Day of Pesach

Therefore, now is the time to emphasize the increase in "returning the hearts of fathers through children."

It would be desirable that on the seventh day of Pesach -- the day they recognized first -- in all places special separate gatherings should be made for the boys and the girls. (In order for those gatherings to be a success, all necessary preparations should be done today.)

Although the gathering will be conducted by people over Bar Mitzvah, "the elders of Israel" (particularly those who have a knowledge in matters of education), -- in fact the honor of the elders consists of conducting such a gathering -- the main emphasis is on the children, to help them bring about "And they recognized Him first." They should be told about Yetzias Mitzrayim, and in particular about the splitting of the sea -- the time at which they declared, "This is my G-d and I will glorify Him."

They should be told that the splitting of the sea is not something that happened then. Rather, it opened the way and it gives the strength for all, beginning with small children, to jump into the water -- the water of Yiddishkeit. They need not be afraid of the world around them, since Torah told them "to travel" to go closer and more deeper into matters of Torah and Mitzvos, to give over their wants and desires -- Mesirus Nefesh -- to Hashem to fulfill His Torah and Mitzvos. And through their role in "I will return the hearts of parents through the children," they cause their parents to give over their desires to Torah and Mitzvos.

At the same time they should be told about Mashiach's Seudah (a third meal eaten on the last day of Pesach; a custom instituted by the Baal Shem Tov). In Israel it is on the same day as the seventh day of Pesach, so both things should be done at the same time. Here, outside of Israel, the children should be told at the same gathering -- on the seventh day of Pesach -- that they should participate in Mashiach's Seudah on the last day of Pesach.
