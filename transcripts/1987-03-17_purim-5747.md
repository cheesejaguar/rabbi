It is customary to always begin with a blessing, and since it is Purim, it should be the blessing, "For the Jews there was light and joy, gladness and honor." There is special assurance that this blessing will be fulfilled, as we say in Havdalah (following this verse) "So too let it be for us."

Furthermore, on Purim all natural boundaries are nullified, as seen in the law that the joy of Purim must be without limitation: ad d'lo yada. This indicates that the blessings associated with Purim are also infinite in character.

This unlimited nature of Purim is further reflected in the requirement of giving charity on Purim, "Give to anyone who stretches forth his hand." On Purim we are given special instructions to give to anyone who asks, and not even to question their worthiness. And since Haman's decree was against all Jews -- men, women and children -- all should give charity in this manner.

Giving charity should be unlimited not only regarding who it is given to, but also as to how much is given. One must assist both the physically needy and the spiritually needy without limitation.

This must not remain in the realm of theory or good intentions, but reach this physical world, the world of action. This is especially true regarding Purim. Chassidus explains why on Purim, unlike other holidays, one is allowed to do work. This is because on other holidays, there is an elevation in all the worlds, rendering the idea of physical work inappropriate and therefore forbidden. On Purim, however, this elevation is unlimited in nature. Therefore, it is able to penetrate the physical realm as well, and physical work is no contradiction. In the same way, our resolutions must be actualized in the physical realm.

Practically speaking, it is now the time to prepare for giving ma'os chittim for Pesach. This is brought by the Alter Rebbe in Shulchan Aruch: that the giving of ma'os chittim begins on Purim. And since we are making our resolutions on Purim, when we are in a spirit which transcends limitation we will certainly be most generous in this as well.

It is also an auspicious time to make other resolutions regarding increasing in Torah and mitzvos. This also includes influencing non-Jews to keep their mitzvos, the Seven Noachide Laws. This also has a special connection with Purim, since the miracle of Purim also affected non-Jews, to the extent that, as said in the Megillah, "many from the non-Jewish nations decided to become Jews."

Lately a question has come up regarding the content of these gatherings. "Why is it," it has been asked, "that there is such lengthy and frequent discussion regarding the redemption?" Farbrengens have taken place for many years, also by previous Rebbeim, and although it was occasionally mentioned, it was never such a central topic. Now, on the other hand, effort is made to discuss it and to show its connection with every single Jew.

True, it was clearly discussed by our Sages and by the Rambam, who said that, "Every individual should view himself...and the whole world as half-meritorious and half-guilty...and by doing one mitzvah he can tip himself and the entire world to the side of good and bring redemption and deliverance." But we have never seen this point continually stressed and repeated before recent years!

There are two explanations regarding why now the Seven Mitzvos must be spread. The simple reason is that in previous generations it was impossible to influence non-Jews in this regard. Any attempt to influence a non-Jew in religious matters would put one's life in danger.

Today, however, we see that the world has changed drastically. Not only is it possible to influence non-Jews without endangering oneself, but they are actually appreciative. When notified that there is a "Super-Being" and that they can help fulfill making the world a better place through keeping the Seven Mitzvos, they see that you care for their well-being.

In spite of the fact that the world has undergone such change, nevertheless Moshiach still has not come. In the times of the Talmud our Sages already said, "kalu kol hakitzin" ("all deadlines for Moshiach's coming have passed"). A new era began when the Previous Rebbe proclaimed, l'altar l'teshuvah, l'altar l'g'eulah ("Do teshuvah now and Moshiach will come now!").

It is decades after these proclamations, and nevertheless, Moshiach still has not come. I have searched and searched for an explanation for this, and the only answer I've found is the following. In previous generations, since haNassi hu hakol ("the Nassi is everything") it was possible to rely on the Nassi's efforts. However, after so long, when even the Previous Rebbe's proclamation has passed and Moshiach still hasn't come, the only possibility is that every single Jew must be involved in bringing the redemption.

It would be appropriate that at every gathering of Jews, it should be announced: "Jews, attention! A single additional good act from one of you could be the final act which brings the redemption!"

There are other areas in which we see radical changes in the world today. Never have we seen such extremes -- both in the positive and in the negative.

The Torah, which sheds "light" and clarity on every situation, also explains the meaning of these developments. Tractate Sotah, in giving the signs of the pre-Messianic period, clearly describes the present era. And regarding this period, the book of Daniel (12:10) says, "Many things will be clarified, refined, and purified...and the wise will understand."

But G-d does everything for the good; what could be positive in this development of extremes, when there are also extremely negative results? The reason is that when evil remains concealed, it cannot be repaired. In fact, the person might even be unaware of its existence. Once this evil is revealed, however, it becomes possible to improve and elevate it.

This is one of the reasons for the recent stress on the Mishnah's statement, "Make for yourself a Rav." Since the Rav is neutral and uninvolved, he will certainly be able to give sound advice.

May it be G-d's will that everyone begin to become actively involved in bringing Moshiach even one moment sooner, with all these moments adding up to the immediate redemption.

There is an obvious connection between the Torah portion and Purim. Parshas Ki Sissa begins with the mitzvah of the half-shekel. The Talmud says that in merit of this mitzvah, the decree of Haman to destroy the Jews was annulled.

To end with a "new decree"! In the past, we have discussed the necessity of every child owning a personal Siddur, Chumash, and tzedakah pushkah. Since it is now 30 days before Pesach, it would be very desirable to prepare Haggadah's for each child. Obviously, they should be made attractively, with pictures, etc., in order to attract the children.

May it be G-d's will that even before the time comes for them to ask and answer these questions on Pesach, that there come the great answer to our biggest question -- the inexplicable continuation of the exile -- with the arrival of Moshiach and the complete redemption.
