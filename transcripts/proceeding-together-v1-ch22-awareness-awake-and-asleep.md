## 1. Awareness of Providence

When the Children of Israel were in the wilderness after leaving Egypt, God provided all their needs -- both spiritual and material -- ready-made: heavenly food, water from Miriam's well, and Clouds of Glory that cleaned their clothes. This occurred because they left Egypt with *mesirus nefesh* (self-sacrifice), not questioning how they would survive without provisions. Instead, they believed and followed God into the unsown wilderness.

In contrast, today when someone is approached for charity, they begin calculating: they must first worry about themselves; giving money now means insufficient funds for next year's expenses; they need reserves for their children's future; and money earned through hard labor shouldn't be given away. Regarding the needy, they argue: "If God made them needy, let Him care for them."

A Jew should remember that when carrying out God's will without calculations, God provides whatever is needed -- both spiritually and materially.

## 2. Awareness When Asleep

The halachic principle states that "a man is always accountable..., whether awake or asleep."

The Rebbe recounted that his father-in-law, the Previous Rebbe, once farbreng on Shabbat with family. He asked his youngest daughter (about five years old) whether she understood that everything on Shabbat should be holy, per Torah. She acknowledged knowing Shabbat was holy to God, feeling this during meals. However, she noted that during her daytime nap, she couldn't think about Shabbat's holiness.

The Rebbe clarified that even during sleep, Shabbat's holiness should remain perceptible and felt -- one remains accountable whether awake or asleep.

## 3. Time to Get Started

The Rebbe elaborated on the Previous Rebbe's Shavuot message (1949): people should stop waiting; the Redemption is being delayed.

## 4. One More Chance

The Rebbe discussed the compensatory period following Shavuot. The Alter Rebbe's prayerbook notes that *Tachanun* (confession) isn't recited during these days through the twelfth of Sivan. During this period, one can correct and compensate for whatever was lacking in one's service on Shavuot.
