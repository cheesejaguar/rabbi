1. Tzivos Hashem members gathered to strengthen Torah and mitzvos observance. "Seek the L-rd while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near" applies to the Ten Days of Repentance, indicating G-d's closeness during this period.

2. The gathering occurs on Wednesday, when "it was good" appears twice in the creation account, symbolizing blessings for both spiritual and physical matters. The Torah portion speaks about honey and oil from rocks, illustrating G-d's provision even in exile. Psalm 23's theme of divine shepherding is also discussed.

3. The 100th anniversary of Rebbe Maharash's passing is noted, highlighting his teaching that Jews should transcend worldly pressures and not fear standing apart when fulfilling Torah obligations.
