1. There are two aspects in Shabbos: Its connection to the preceding week, as our Sages said "Whoever toils on Erev Shabbos eats on Shabbos," meaning one's work before Shabbos enables one to enjoy Shabbos properly; and its connection to the following week, whose days are blessed from the Shabbos. It follows then that Shabbos joins together the days preceding and following it.

Shabbos Bereishis in particular joins together the month of Tishrei with the rest of the year. It is always at the end of the month of Tishrei, and therefore the days of the preceding week are all days of Tishrei. Simultaneously, we bless the month of Cheshvan on Shabbos Bereishis, meaning that (at least part of) the following week are days of Cheshvan. Thus the function of Shabbos Bereishis is to join together Tishrei and the rest of the year beginning from Cheshvan.

The above lends understanding to the greatness and precious nature of a farbrengen held on Shabbos Bereishis. A farbrengen at any time is a lofty thing, for, as the Alter Rebbe said, it has the power to effect more than the angel Michoel can. In addition, at a farbrengen on Shabbos Bereishis, one is given special strength to increase in the good resolutions undertaken during Tishrei -- for that is the idea of Shabbos Bereishis: to join together and extend the concepts of Tishrei to the whole year.

Extra emphasis to this is given by the adage of the Rebbeim that "the way a person conducts himself on Shabbos Bereishis, so goes one the entire year." That conduct on Shabbos Bereishis affects that of the entire year, applies to both spiritual and physical matters.

In practical terms, the time of Shabbos Bereishis must be utilized to strengthen resolutions for one's service for the whole year, and to actually fulfill them. And since it is now Shabbos Bereishis, these resolutions must first and foremost be in matters associated with Shabbos: The campaign to kindle Shabbos lights; Kashrus; and family purity.

Besides these campaigns, special emphasis must be laid on Ahavas Yisroel and unity among Jews. Every action of man needs G-d's blessing -- "The L-rd your G-d will bless you in all that you do." To receive G-d's blessings one must be included in and united with all Jewry, for unity of Jews is the vessel for receiving G-d's blessings.

2. The above applies on every Shabbos Bereishis. In addition, there is a special lesson from this year's date -- the 29th of Tishrei. This is associated with Rosh Hashanah being on Shabbos, for when Rosh Hashanah is on Shabbos, Shabbos Bereishis must fall on the 29th of Tishrei. Thus the special distinction of this year is that the beginning of Tishrei (Rosh Hashanah) and its conclusion (Shabbos Bereishis) are on Shabbos, meaning that the concept of "the beginning is rooted in the end" applies also in the days of the week.

Since the Yomim Tovim this year stress the idea of Shabbos, it follows that the service of the rest of the year is similar to the type of service of Shabbos. "Shabbos is sanctified of itself," without any need of man's service. Simultaneously however, man's service also has a place, by adding to the ta'anug (delight) of Shabbos. When service is with delight, it is much easier, to the extent that no effort is needed at all.

3. Ch. 1, verse 4 of parshas Bereishis states: "G-d saw the light that it was good, and G-d divided between the light and the darkness." Rashi comments: "For this too we need the words of the Aggadah: He saw the light that it was not fitting that the wicked should use it, and so He set it aside for the righteous for the future to come. And according to its plain meaning, explain it thus: He saw that it was good, and it was not seemly for it and the darkness that they should function mixed together, and so He set for this one the light its limit in the day, and for the other the darkness its limit in the night."

Division can be in two ways: Between two different things; or within one thing itself. In our case, "G-d saw the light that it was good and He divided" refers to a division in the "light" itself. There were two elements present in the light: the "light" and the fact that "it was good." That is, in addition to "G-d said: let there be light and there was light," G-d saw an extra element -- "that it was good."

Thus, "G-d saw the light that it was good and He divided," means G-d divided between the "good" in the light and the essence of the light (its illuminating function). He did this when He saw that "it was not fitting that the wicked should use it," and therefore "set aside the 'good' in the light for the righteous for the future to come." Therefore there is no difficulty how there is now light in the world, for the setting aside was only in relation to the extra element of "goodness," and not the light itself.

The explanation of the light and darkness functioning "mixed together" is not that both light and darkness simultaneously reigned, for that would indeed be impossible. Rather, it means there were no fixed, stable times for when the light and darkness would separately rule. Instead, one hour would be light, another hour darkness. The effect of the division was that "He set for this one its limit in the day, and the other its limit in the night."
