Our Sages taught, "Whoever labors on Friday, will eat on Shabbos." Similarly, the spiritual influences of Friday affect the nature of the Shabbos. Thus, the present Shabbos benefits from the influence of Friday, the fifteenth of the month, the day on which the moon shines fully.

Similarly, the influence of Shabbos continues until Tuesday which in this coming week is also a unique day, Yud-Tes Kislev, the "holiday of holidays," the Rosh HaShanah of Chassidus. (Indeed, there is an intrinsic connection between Yud-Tes Kislev and Tuesday, for it was on this day of the week that the Alter Rebbe's redemption took place. This is reflected in his recitation of Psalm 55, part of the section of Tehillim recited in connection with Tuesday. When he recited the verse from that psalm, "He redeemed my soul in peace," he was informed about his liberation.)

The nature of that lesson can be understood by a comparison between Yud-Tes Kislev and other holidays. Pesach and Sukkos fall on the fifteenth of the month, the time when the moon shines fully. Shavuos falls in the first half of the month. In contrast, Yud-Tes Kislev falls in the second half of the month, the time when the moon is waning. Similarly, Chanukah is celebrated at the time of the waning of the moon. Indeed, in the midst of that holiday, the moon becomes totally obscured.

The above concepts relate to the service of the Jewish people who "resemble the moon" and "establish their calendar according to the moon." Seemingly, since the moon wanes in the second half of the month, rather than continue counting the days in ascending order, it would be proper to count in descending order. This, however, is not the case. The rationale is the principle "Always ascend higher in holy matters; never descend." Although on a revealed level, there is less light, inwardly, a process of ascent is taking place.

The sun and the moon are a classic example of a mashpia (source of influence) and a mekabel (recipient). The moon has no light of its own and receives its light from the sun. It is only in the Era of the Redemption, with the fulfillment of the prophecy, "And the light of the moon will resemble the light of the sun," that the moon will reach true fulfillment.

When the mekabel is close to the mashpia, because of the bittul he feels, he cannot reflect any light. His energies are focused on receiving. It is only when he removes himself from the mashpia, that he begins to shine forth light. On a deeper level: The reduction in light reflects a connection to the essence which is hidden, above the concept of revelation. The revelation of light by definition indicates that one is separate from the essence. Through reducing this revelation, one draws closer to the essence.

When the mekabel unites with the mashpia on an equal basis, then the essence is in revelation. The moon's waning in the second half of the month is a diminution only in regard to revelation. In essence, even in the second half of the month, the moon -- and symbolically, the Jewish people -- are growing.

This is particularly relevant to the month of Kislev, the third winter month, paralleling Sivan, the third summer month associated with the giving of the Torah. Similarly, Kislev is associated with the giving of P'nimiyus HaTorah as reflected in the teachings of Chassidus.

The giving of the Torah represents the marriage between G-d and the Jewish people. On one level, G-d is the mashpia and the Jews, the mekabel, but on a deeper level, the ultimate intent is that the union should be complete and total oneness achieved.

The name Kislev represents a fusion of opposites. Kis refers to hiddenness. Lo, in contrast, reflects the ultimate in revelation for it is numerically equivalent to 36. Thus the name Kislev reflects a fusion of revelation and hiddenness -- the revelation of the essence which was previously concealed.

To emphasize the unity associated with the revelation of Chassidus, Yud-Tes Kislev is celebrated in the second half of the month, the portion in which the moon draws close to the sun in preparation for their union.

The positive nature of this time is further emphasized by Chanukah, which emphasizes the concept of increasing light. Although the light of the moon is waning, on each night of Chanukah, we add light showing that the reduction in light is only on an external level and in essence, we are constantly adding light.

The difference between Ya'akov's activities in Parshas Vayishlach and Vayeishev compared to the parshiyos Toldos and Vayeitze is that Vayishlach and Vayeishev describe Yaakov after he reached a state in which he was prepared for the Redemption.

This is the message which Yaakov gave to the messengers he sent to Esav. As explained in Torah Or, he told them that he had completed all the service dependent on him and was expecting Esav to have completed the service depending on him so that they could proceed to the Redemption together.

The moon is used as an analogy for Yaakov. Just as the moon is described as "the small luminary" and in regard to Yaakov, it is written, "How shall Yaakov stand, for he is small?" The task of refinement involves the elevation of the sparks of G-dliness that fell when the vessels of Tohu shattered. The shattering of the vessels was caused by the diminution of the moon. When that service is completed, the moon will no longer need to be small and will be elevated to the state that it also will be a "great light."

In the present age, to borrow an expression from the Previous Rebbe, "We have already polished the buttons." The task of refinement entrusted to the Jews has been completed. This is particularly true because of the influence of Yud-Tes Kislev which is associated with the spreading of the wellsprings of Chassidus outward.

Thus we are now living in a new era with a new service. Instead of concentrating on the refinement of the world, our efforts must focus on revealing the Redemption. The Era of Redemption which is described with the analogy of a feast, is a present reality, all that is necessary is for us to open our eyes and see.

We must use the unique influence of the present year to organize Chassidic farbrengens to commemorate the holidays of redemption, Yud-Tes Kislev and Chof Kislev. Farbrengens should be held in every Jewish community. Instead of holding a single large farbrengen, it is preferable to hold farbrengens in many different places, causing these farbrengens to be "great" in a spiritual sense.

Every person should participate in many such farbrengens (preferably, at least three, for three is connected with a chazakah). In these gatherings, those attending should inspire each other to increase their observance of the three pillars of service -- Torah, prayer, and deeds of kindness -- alluded to in the verse, "He redeemed my soul in peace." And this will lead to the era when "I (G-d) and My children will be redeemed from among the nations." Ya'akov's wish to dwell in prosperity will be fulfilled and as the Haftorah concludes "Saviors will ascend Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esav and sovereignty will be the L-rd's."
