1. Simchas Bais Hashoevah represents an extraordinarily joyful occasion. As the Sages taught, "Whoever has not seen Simchas Bais Hashoevah has not seen joy in his life." Though originally celebrated in the Temple, its principles remain eternal. In the current exile, "we render the prayer of our lips as payment for the sacrifice of bullocks." Proper payment requires completeness; therefore, contemporary observances match their historical counterparts fully.

All matters occurring in Tishrei -- the year's opening month -- carry comprehensive significance. Rosh Hashanah establishes accepting the divine yoke annually; Sukkos sources the entire year's joy. Simchas Bais Hashoevah, being all-encompassing, remains fully celebratory even during exile. Each successive evening requires deepening joyful intensity.

Sustained nightly joy demands novelty. The "Sheva Berachos" blessings following marriage exemplify this principle -- a "new face" attending each gathering enhances celebration. In Sukkos, seven distinguished guests visit sequentially: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph, and David. Though all appear each day, one leads distinctively.

2. Moses, tonight's guest, uniquely contributed Torah transmission. Scripture instructs: "Remember the Torah of Moses My servant." The Sages explained that because he sacrificed himself entirely for Torah, it bears his name. He earned the title "Moses our Teacher" because Torah constituted his primary contribution, though he excelled across numerous domains.

Simchas Bais Hashoevah fundamentally demonstrates complete faith in Moses' Torah. The observance centers on water libation -- drawing water joyfully. Though wine accompaniments feature in written Torah and produce festivity, water libation presents a remarkable concept since water lacks obvious connections to joy.

"You shall draw water with joy" constitutes a striking paradox. Therefore, principal celebration surrounds water drawing rather than wine, despite wine's explicit scriptural mention versus water's appearance only in Oral Torah. This emphasis proves necessary: highlighting that Oral Law parallels Written Torah as equally Mosaic in origin justified tremendous jubilation.

A Talmudic account illustrates this principle. Sadducees rejected Oral Law, accepting only written texts. Since water libation appeared nowhere in written scripture, they rejected it. One Sadducee priest poured water over his feet instead of correctly onto the altar. The people responded by stoning him with their citrons.

The water-pouring over feet demonstrated the Sadducee's philosophy: personal intellect determines validity. Whatever transcends individual understanding, he rejected as non-Mosaic. Feet represent the opposite of honored service requiring hands. His refusal acknowledged only self-comprehended material.

The punishment bore specific meaning: "stoned him" emphasized his heart's hardness. "All the people" -- common folk rather than scholars -- possessed simple faith in G-d and unwavering belief that Moses received Torah with its interpretation. Their esrog stoning proved particularly significant: the esrog, possessing both taste and fragrance, symbolizes the intellect, humanity's highest faculty. Their intellectual capacity, thoroughly permeated with simple faith, eradicated the Sadducee attempting to undermine their belief in complete Mosaic Torah.

3. Each guest corresponds to the daily Torah portion. Today's guest involves Moses, whose portion comprises Moshe's blessing to Joseph's tribe from Deuteronomy. Moses' blessing to Joseph declares: "To Yosef he said: His land shall be blessed by the L-rd, with the precious things of heaven, with dew, and with the waters that lie deep..." Rashi interprets "precious things" as delicacies, embodying pleasure and delight. Joseph's blessing encompasses all blessings manifesting through delight.

Joseph's concept, as contained within Moses (today's guest), represents delight in Torah. Since Moses epitomizes Torah, Joseph's delight concept transfers to Torah study. The word "precious things" appears five times, corresponding to Torah's five books.

Torah receives the designation "bread." Accordingly, delight in spiritual bread (Torah) descends into physical bread. Moses provided the Israelites desert bread -- manna -- whose "taste was like wafers made with honey" and "like the taste of oil cake." Honey and oil signify delight. Similarly, earthly bread achieves blessing through finest wheat and rock honey.

Practically, the Sages teach: "The Torah was not given except to the eaters of the manna." During Torah study, students must replicate manna consumers -- eschewing livelihood worries, dedicating existence entirely to learning. This approach automatically produces delightful study because no distractions intervene.

Delight in Torah also connects to today's "Chassidic guest," the Mitteler Rebbe. He distinguished himself through elaborate, extensive Chassidic explanations, manifesting delight -- contrasting with seminal form concepts. The Mitteler Rebbe's teachings unveil delight in esoteric study, mirroring delight in Mosaic Torah.
