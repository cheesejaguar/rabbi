1. There is a simple reason why we should rejoice today, to share in the joy of Rashbi (Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai) who wanted all who are connected to him to be happy with his joy. It is related in the writings of the Arizal that there was a student of the Arizal who customarily recited the lamentation of "Nachem" every day of the year. He also said it on Lag B'Omer. As a result, the Rashbi was very upset with him and it affected him.

This is a day of great joy which should be observed by all who are connected to the Rashbi -- by all the Jews. How so? The Rashbi said: "I am able to exempt the whole world from judgment ..." (Sukkah 45b), which shows that indeed he had a relationship to the whole generation. He did in fact shield the generation. His potential was actualized -- which is why his joy is everyone's joy, and there is no greater joy than being freed of all negative aspects.

The Rashbi accomplished this through his Divine service of Torah study -- and more specifically by combining the hidden and revealed aspects of Torah, the esoteric and exoteric teachings of Torah. His accomplishment has also been revealed to us through Torah tradition -- the Torah of truth and life. And because through Torah we can reach the true unity, it brings still greater joy to all Jews.

2. It has been our custom all through this year to find some connection in every farbrengen with the daily Rambam portion. But first we should explain the connection between the Rashbi and the Rambam.

The Rashbi's soul was a spark of the soul of Moshe, the "faithful shepherd." The Rambam's theme was similar to Moshe's, for his magnum opus was the Mishneh Torah -- the "repetition of the Torah," or the "second" to the Scriptures, the book of Moshe.

Yet a question arises: the Rashbi's book, the Zohar, is the "soul" of the Torah, dealing with esoteric matters; the Rambam's work gives us halachos (detailed laws) which is the exoteric aspect of Torah. Where do we see the commonality? The answer is that the Rambam does deal with esoterics. Right at the outset the Rambam deals with the "chariot" of Yechezkel. Then at the close of Mishneh Torah: "they will know the things that are now concealed ... and will attain an understanding of their Creator to the utmost capacity of the human mind." This is essentially the knowledge of the chariot! In fact, not only the chariot but the "rider" on the chariot -- the true knowledge of G-d.

You might think that only the beginning of Mishneh Torah and its conclusion deal with these lofty spiritual matters of knowing G-d, and the main text deals with more down-to-earth laws. Therefore it should be clear that the halachos throughout the body of the book do not separate the beginning from the end. Rather they unite, for "the 'word of the L-rd' means Halachah," which unites all aspects of the Rambam. For the Halachah reveals the word of G-d and the will of G-d, and thus the knowledge of G-d is revealed.

Whether we speak of the Hilulo of the Rashbi, or the Rambam, we recognize the vast magnitude of Torah and spirituality of the day. This leads us to question: "What can the study of one more halachah, or one more chapter in Rambam, add to such an illustrious day?"

There is an obvious response. True, all is revealed at the time of death, but the ultimate goal of existence, to create an abode for G-d in the temporal world, can be realized only by practical, daily observance of mitzvos. "It must be done today." Quite obviously this cannot happen after death.

Similarly on the day of Hilulo the greatest thing that we can do is to study the Torah teachings of the tzaddik, e.g. the Zohar of Rashbi, and this act will cause "G-d to study facing him," and bring about the true goal of existence.

We earlier connected the work of Rashbi and the work of Rambam. In Kabbalah it is taught that, "With the Book of Zohar we will go out of the golus with mercy."

May G-d grant that by speaking on and on about Zohar we will merit soon to be redeemed from the golus with mercy. Especially now, since the time of the Arizal and the Baal Shem Tov, that it is a mitzvah to reveal the esoteric teachings. And especially as Chabad Chassidus brings understanding to the inner teachings of the Torah, which brings first to knowledge, and then to good attributes, and then to action.

May it be speedily in our time, pleasant and peaceful, the true and complete redemption through our righteous Moshiach, momentarily and instantaneously.

3. While we have begun the study of the new cycle of the Rambam it is still important to organize and arrange additional siyyumim -- celebrations of the Rambam for those who have concluded the first cycle.

Recently there have been those who have scoffed at the emphasis on Rambam study, claiming that they are protecting the honor of the Rambam. For some reason they do not want the Rambam studied! And the effect of their scoffing is to turn people away from Rambam study! What honor is that?

The Gemara says: "When a statement of tradition is reported in this world in the name of a deceased scholar, his lips move gently in the grave." Thus when the average Jew studies Rambam he causes the Rambam to leave his activities in Gan Eden and to move his lips, as if speaking, in his grave in Teveriah. This movement will affect the atmosphere in the tomb and it will also affect the atmosphere of the world. By learning an halachah in the Rambam, he will effect an improvement in the entire world!

4. In discussing the theme of the 33rd of the Omer, Chassidus explains that the specific attribute (Sefirah) assigned to this day is "splendor of splendor" (Hod ShebeHod) -- this compound attribute is seen as the last one and the conclusion of the main emotive attributes esoterically known as the "body." Beyond the attribute of "splendor of splendor" the "body" ends, and the flow of benevolence goes outside the main "body" till the Sefirah of "royalty of royalty."

"Hod ShebeHod" is the conclusion of the main "body" of attributes and it assumes the role of "praise of praise" in Divine service. But it also is bound to the beginning. Thus, specifically in the compound "splendor of splendor" we see the revelation of the highest level; for the end is bound with the beginning.

Consequently, we realize that while concluding the main phase of influence of the compounded attributes, at the same time we introduce the next phases -- from Yesod to Malchus -- and thereby, Lag B'Omer becomes a beginning -- a Rosh -- similar to Rosh Hashanah.

The ultimate perfection and the ultimate state of sanctity will, of course, be attained with the coming of Moshiach, when the only preoccupation will be to know G-d.

May G-d grant that by speaking of the Kohanic role and responsibility we should merit to see the Kohanim in their service in the Temple. For in a split second, "a King will arise from the House of David ... and fight the battle of the L-rd ... and rebuild the Sanctuary on its site." And if we are really worthy the Bais Hamikdosh will not have to be built, for it stands ready in the Jerusalem above. It just has to be uncovered and brought down by Moshiach -- so there are no time limitations -- it can happen even at night, even on Shabbos.

Then the true redemption will come, for he will gather all the dispersed Jews, just as the Rambam gathered all the laws of Torah and put them into one book, the Mishneh Torah, which is a preparation for Moshiach. Speedily and truly in our days with joy and gladness of heart.
