The sicho addresses the daily Torah portion for Simchas Torah and its spiritual significance.

The text discusses whether the daily reading encompasses parshas Berachah alone or also includes the beginning of parshas Bereishis, referencing the "Hayom Yom" calendar from 5703 as the authoritative source.

The discourse examines why the word "this" appears in "This is the blessing which Moshe blessed," concluding that it emphasizes the eternally revealed and openly evident nature of Moshe's blessings to all Jews.

The text connects G-d's revelation as King to the unity of the Jewish people, distinguishing between "yachad" (transcendent unity) and "echad" (unity within division), and explaining how Ahavas Yisroel (love of fellow Jews) leads to genuine unity.

The discourse demonstrates how the parshah's conclusion strengthens its beginning through Jewish service, and how this principle applies to the entire Torah cycle, with references to spiritual "Be fruitful and multiply."
