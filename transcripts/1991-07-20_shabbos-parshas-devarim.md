**Date:** July 20, 1991 (9th Day of Menachem Av, 5751)
**Occasion:** Shabbos Chazon -- Shabbos Parshas Devarim (Tishah BeAv falling on Shabbos)
**Source:** Sichos In English, Volume 49

This farbrengen was delivered on Shabbos Chazon, with subsequent sichos from the eves of the eleventh and twelfth of Av combined and edited together.

The teaching emphasizes the principle that believers must "await his coming every day," expecting redemption on each particular day itself.

When Tishah BeAv falls on Shabbos, mourning observances are suspended. The text notes that "since it was postponed, let it be nullified," reflecting potential complete nullification through redemption.

Parallels are drawn between Tishah BeAv and Yom Kippur, including similar prohibitions and the eating of fine foods as a merit.

The discourse encourages increased Torah study, charitable giving, and making siyyumim (festive meals marking completion of Talmudic tractates) through the Fifteenth of Av.

The three parshiyos of the Three Weeks all reference Jewish entry into and division of the Land, symbolizing future redemption when "Eretz Yisrael will expand."
