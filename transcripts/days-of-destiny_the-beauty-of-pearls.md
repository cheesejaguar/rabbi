# The Beauty of Pearls

**Occasion:** 19th of Kislev
**Source:** Days of Destiny, Sichos In English

---

The nineteenth of Kislev commemorates the release of R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi (the Alter Rebbe) from Czarist imprisonment. He founded the Chabad school of Chassidus and authored the Tanya. False accusations from movement opponents led to his arrest, but investigation cleared him entirely. His vindication validated Chassidus itself and energized its dissemination.

## Two Purposes of Chassidus

The text explains two reasons why Chassidus emerged in later generations:

1. **Defensive Function**: As spiritual darkness intensifies during exile, Chassidus reveals the soul's latent powers, enabling Jews to fulfill their divine mission despite increasingly difficult conditions.

2. **Positive Function**: Chassidus prepares humanity for the Messianic age by revealing Torah's secrets now, mirroring the redemption when "the earth will be full of the knowledge of the L-rd as the waters cover the sea."

## The Coal and Pearl Parable

The Previous Rebbe distinguished between these purposes through a mining metaphor. Coal generates necessary warmth and light (the defensive aspect), while pearls represent luxury items needed for royal courts (the positive aspect of uniting with G-d).

Both require personal effort — the Rebbe provides guidance, but each individual must actively engage through consistent, thorough study of Chassidus.

## Preparing for Redemption

As redemption approaches, the focus shifts from coal's survival function to pearls' adornment. The Jewish people must prepare themselves through abundant Chassidus study to meet the "wedding" with G-d — the true redemption.
