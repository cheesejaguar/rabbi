Our sages have taught: "Every day they (the Torah) should be to you as something new." (Rashi, Devorim 26:16)

This "newness" must actually be felt as if the Torah were actually being given to us on this day. This approach is certainly appropriate on the day of the giving of the Torah.

Here we emphasize the fact that although we have the Torah a long time, yet, it is new. Clearly this does not negate the qualities of something which is old -- rather it adds a facet of freshness. In our Divine service we should follow a pattern where we begin with the tried and then advance to the newer things.

At this farbrengen we will deal with new ideas and facets -- nevertheless, one should begin with the general theme of the Season of the Giving of our Torah even though this subject has been duly covered in past years.

The concepts of Torah and prayer complement each other. Prayer is the request for G-d to grant our needs. Torah is, essentially, G-d's wisdom, and it bestows on those who study it the power to fulfill the commandments. Although these seem distinct, there is a fundamental connection between them. Prayer elevates human beings to G-dliness while Torah brings G-dliness to the human realm.

The inner dimension of prayer involves making ourselves into a vessel for Divine blessing. The Alter Rebbe explains in Likkutei Torah that through the meditation of the Shema and its blessings, the Jew raises his soul to unite with G-d's essence. Similarly through Torah study, G-d's wisdom and will are brought into the human mind. The two together create a complete union between the soul and G-d.

This concept is connected to the structure of the morning service before the Torah reading. The blessings, the Shema, and the Amidah form a progression: from acknowledging G-d's existence, to accepting His kingship, to actually speaking to Him "face to face" in silent prayer. When this progression is complete, the person is ready to receive Torah.

## Connection to Moshe, Dovid, and the Baal Shem Tov

Shavuos has a unique triple connection. Moshe Rabbeinu is linked to Shavuos because the Torah was given through him. King Dovid, whose yartzeit falls on Shavuos, is connected because the Written Torah (associated with the sun) was given to Israel through Moshe, while the Oral Torah (associated with the moon) was developed through the line of Dovid. The Baal Shem Tov, whose yartzeit also falls on Shavuos, represents the inner dimension of Torah, Pnimiyus HaTorah, which he revealed and spread to the world.

The Written Torah and Oral Torah are compared to the sun and the moon. The sun radiates its own light, while the moon reflects the sun's light. Similarly, the Written Torah is G-d's direct communication, while the Oral Torah represents how human intellect receives and develops that communication.

This relationship is similar to the father-mother dynamic discussed in Chassidic thought. The father (Written Torah) provides the initial seed in a concealed manner, while the mother (Oral Torah) develops and reveals it in a manifest way. In a spiritual sense, the Written Torah contains all potential laws and insights, and the Oral Torah brings them into full revelation and practical application.

The Baal Shem Tov united these two dimensions by revealing the inner life-force within both the Written and Oral Torah. His approach showed that even the simplest Jew, through sincere prayer and faith, could access the deepest levels of Torah.

## Torah Study and Action

The practical conclusion from all the above is the imperative to increase Torah study, particularly the study of both Nigleh (the revealed dimension of Torah) and Pnimiyus HaTorah (the inner dimension), and to translate this study into action -- the performance of mitzvos with joy and gladness of heart.

Since Shavuos is "the season of the giving of our Torah," it is fitting that we accept good resolutions to increase in Torah study and the performance of mitzvos, particularly in the area of education (chinuch), ensuring that every Jewish child receives a proper Torah education.

May the merit of our Torah study and mitzvah performance hasten the coming of Moshiach, when the "new Torah" will be revealed, speedily and in our days.
