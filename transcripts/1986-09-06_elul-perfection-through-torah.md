On Shabbos Mevorchim Elul, 5746, the Lubavitcher Rebbe Shlita, in his discourses devoted much attention to the theme of Elul: teshuvah, redemption, Torah, avodah, and acts of loving kindness. The reading of the portion Re'ey on this Shabbos enhances this potential by focusing on the reality and clarity of man's perception of his Divine mission.

Many laws of the Shemittah (fallow) year apply during the month of Elul, and in preparing for Shemittah we should lend assistance to our brethren in Eretz Yisroel who face financial difficulties, because of the restrictions of Shemittah.

The Shemittah year also suspends the collection of personal debts unless one makes a Pruzbul. This should be done at the close of the sixth year, preferably on the morning of Erev Rosh Hashanah.

The theme of the month of Elul, which is blessed on this Shabbos Mevorchim, is teshuvah, repentance.

Being the last month of the outgoing year it is the proper time for serious spiritual soul-reckoning for the past year. The purpose of this retrospective is to correct and perfect any deficient aspect of our Divine service of the past year, through teshuvah.

This stock-taking also constitutes a fitting and proper preparation for the new year, may it be a good and blessed year.

The Five Acrostics of Elul

Our sages have taught us that the word E'L'U'L comprises an acrostic for the initial letters of several key phrases which convey the inner essence and meaning of the month of Elul:

Torah

...[but G-d] caused it to happen, then I will provide [a place of refuge]. (Shemos 21:13)

This verse refers to the "cities of refuge" in Eretz Yisroel and symbolizes that the month of Elul is a month of refuge through Torah. As the Talmud relates:

The study of Torah affords asylum. (Makkos 10a)

Prayer

I am [devoted] to my Beloved and my Beloved is [devoted] to me." (Shir Hashirim 6:3)

This signifies the intrinsic bond and connection between a Jew and the Holy One, Blessed be He, through prayer. Chassidus explains that the word "tefillah" -- prayer -- means bonding and joining:

Tefillah has the meaning of bonding as in the verse "By bonds from G-d have I been joined..." (Bereishis 30:8).
