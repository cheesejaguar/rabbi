[The Rebbe asked the children to sing a niggun and recite 12 verses from Torah and Sayings of the Sages.]

**1.** Our sages teach that "in every generation a person must regard himself as though he personally departed from Egypt." This applies especially during Nissan, the month of redemption, and particularly on Rosh Chodesh Nissan -- the month's head -- which sets the tone for the entire month.

**2.** Understanding the Exodus requires examining the two weeks beforehand. On Rosh Chodesh Nissan, G-d commanded the Jews to prepare for departure by accepting His commandments, especially the Pesach sacrifice. When Moshe conveyed this, "all the Jews accepted G-d's command" immediately and carried out their decision.

**3.** Children played a special role during the Exodus preparation. They fulfilled commandments -- particularly the Pesach sacrifice -- with greater warmth than adults. When G-d split the Red Sea on the seventh day of Pesach, "the children were the first to recognize Him" because of their exceptional preparation.

**4.** Since we must imagine ourselves leaving Egypt today, we should emulate our ancestors' example. Children should prepare for Pesach with the same vigor their forebears demonstrated, positioning themselves to recognize the Mashiach first upon his arrival.

**5.** Practically, children should respectfully approach their parents requesting they undertake G-d's commandments and prepare properly for Pesach -- searching for, destroying, and selling Chametz. They should encourage their parents' friends similarly.

**6.** Beyond encouraging parents, children must study Pesach laws and the Mah Nishtanah to properly ask questions at the Seder. They should promise to assist with preparations and encourage peers to do likewise, embodying "love your fellowman as yourself."

**7.** Another significant event occurred on Rosh Chodesh Nissan: the Mishkan's erection. Preparation began in Egypt when Yaakov planted trees and instructed his children to bring the wood for the Mishkan's boards. Children younger than Bar-Mitzvah and Bas-Mitzvah age contributed to the Mishkan's construction.

**8.** Just as Jews prepared for the Mishkan while in Egypt, we must prepare for the third Bais HaMikdash during our exile. Since the Bais HaMikdash will resemble the original Mishkan -- a "dwelling place" for G-d's presence -- we must make our homes dwelling places by conducting everything according to His will. This applies to all household members, especially children who declared at the Red Sea crossing, demonstrating close relationship with G-d.

**9.** When the Mishkan was erected, tribal leaders offered sacrifices on consecutive days. On Rosh Chodesh Nissan -- the first day -- Nachshon ben Aminadav of Yehudah brought his offering. Nachshon demonstrated critical wisdom: when Egyptians pursued the Jews at the Red Sea and many felt afraid, Nachshon fearlessly jumped into the sea upon hearing G-d's command to proceed. Only then did the sea split, teaching that faithfulness to G-d's will eliminates fear.

**10.** Today, on Rosh Chodesh Nissan, we must resolve to follow Nachshon's example. Despite exile and difficulties preventing fulfillment of G-d's will, we must overcome obstacles. From this day forward, we prepare for redemption regardless of challenges, bringing "Pesach sacrifices" -- making holy what G-d desires. Through this, G-d provides all necessary physical and spiritual sustenance.

**11.** Acting this way, Jewish children become part of "G-d's army," enlisting their parents. Scripture states: "He will return the hearts of fathers to the sons."

**12.** By fulfilling Torah, we greet Mashiach with children leading. Mashiach will remove each Jew from exile -- achieving national completeness -- and lead us to the Holy Land, completing it entirely for the Jewish people. This occurs through each person's complete Torah fulfillment -- studying and performing Mitzvos -- bringing true, complete redemption through Mashiach, speedily in our days.

**13.** The Mishnah teaches the world stands on three pillars: Torah, Avodah (prayer), and Gemilus Chassodim (kindness). The afternoon service completed the prayer pillar; reciting 12 verses fulfilled the Torah pillar. Therefore, the third pillar -- kindness through charity -- should follow.

**14.** Since children "recognized first," they should give Tzedakah. If possible on this special day, each child receives a coin for immediate charitable giving before leaving. Thus the three pillars -- Torah, Avodah, and Gemilus Chassodim -- alluded to in "Zion will be redeemed with judgment, and those who return to her with Tzedakah" will hasten Mashiach's arrival.

[The Rebbe noted Tzedakah collection boxes were available and distributed dimes to boys and girls for immediate giving.]
