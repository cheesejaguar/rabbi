We find a parallel to the commandment in this week's Torah reading, "You shall appoint judges and officers in all your gates," in the promise of Yeshayahu, the prophet of the Redemption, "And I will return your judges as in former times, and your advisers as at the beginning." This mode of expression is also used in the weekday prayers "Return our judges as in former times, and our advisers as at the beginning."

According to what has been mentioned many times, and especially recently -- regarding the proclamation of the previous Rebbe "Immediately to repentance (and thereby automatically) immediately to redemption": Everything necessary for the redemption has been completed, including "polishing the buttons"; so that all that is now needed is that "all should stand ready" -- and that this has also been done -- to receive Mashiach immediately. Thus it is understood that we have already reached the time for the fulfillment of the promise "And I will return your judges... and your advisers," and even more so "as at the beginning." This has already begun, as will be explained.

In order to understand this, it is necessary to understand some differences in the language of the promise made by Yeshayahu and the commandment mentioned in our Torah portion:

1. In the commandment in our portion, the words "judges and officers" are used, whereas in the promise, only the words "Your judges" appears, and "officers" is not mentioned. However, the words "and your advisers" is added.

2. What is the import of these two categories "judges" and "advisers"?

3. Why is the term "as in former times," used in connection with "judges", and "as at the beginning" used connection with "advisers"?

4. Why the use of the second person, "your" judges, "your" advisers as against the simple term "judges and advisers"?

These questions can be resolved as follows:

The difference between "judges" and "officers" is explained by Rashi to mean: Judges decide the law; and the officers of the court administer the decisions. If necessary, they strike and bind with a rod or lash until a defendant takes upon himself the decision of the judge.

According to this explanation, it is understandable why only "your judges" are mentioned in connection with the promise of redemption, and not "officers." In the future the existence of evil at large, and the evil inclination within man, will be abolished. There will be no necessity for officers to compel the people to accept the rulings of the judges; everyone will do so of his own free will. It will only be necessary to have "judges" who will decide the law, teach Torah, and give instructions on the teachings of the Torah and its commandments to the Jews.

This idea is also hinted at in the name of the Torah portion, Shoftim (without the word shotrim, "officers"), for an entity's name expresses its inner content.

The question, however arises: How does the name of the Torah portion, Shoftim, fit in with the commandments whose content apparently also includes "officers"? The Midrash goes further and says that if there is no officer of the court, then there is no judge. For when a court rules that a debtor has to pay his debt, if there is no officer to enforce the court's ruling, the judge has no power to enforce his ruling.

To resolve this, we must say that the object of having officers is not an independent purpose, but only to help the judges. If a judge cannot enforce his ruling, the officers, who have the "rod and the lash" are there to force a recalcitrant debtor to accept the ruling of the judge. Hence, the Torah portion is called only Shoftim. And for this same reason, the appointment of officers is not counted as an individual mitzvah in the reckoning of 613 mitzvos, but is included as part of the mitzvah to appoint judges -- namely, because the purpose of having officers is only part of the duties of judges. It is not, however, an absolute necessity, for the law can be carried out voluntary, without coercion as will take place in the Era of the Redemption.

We can now understand the reason why in the prophetic promise, the words "your advisers" was added to "your judges." In the Era of the Redemption, the Jews will reach a state of perfection that will cause them to carry out the rulings of the judges without the need for officers. And this will come about, because in addition to "judges," there will be "advisers."

The simple difference between a judge and an adviser is that a judge is not to be compared to the one who is being judged, he is on a far higher plane. He has a greater knowledge and understanding of the laws, and accordingly the litigants feel subordination in his presence. (This is necessary so that they will accept the verdict even if it is not to their liking.)

In contrast, an adviser is what his name implies -- he gives good advice. This indicates that the adviser is more or less on the same level as the person he advises. Indeed, the adviser speaks to him, not from above to below, as with a decree, but as a good friend who speaks to him on a basis of equality. He gives him good advice on how to behave, advice that his listener can understand and accept with a feeling that his advice will benefit him.

We can apply similar concepts to explain the difference between the terms "your judges" and "your advisers" used in the prophetic promise mentioned above: Each one contains an advantage over the other. The advantage of the adviser is that he is more readily accepted by the advised. His counsel penetrates the inner being of the advised, because the latter accepts that this is good advice for him.

In contrast, the advantage of the judge, is that although his ruling comes as a command, because he is on a much higher plane than the judged, this in itself is a plus. The judge has the power given by the Torah to make these rulings (which is a far greater power than that of the adviser, who is on the same level as his listener). Indeed, the nature of his rulings force the person to accept them (whereas with advice one has a choice to accept it or not).

In other words: whereas with a judge the main stress is on the status of the judge, with the adviser, the main stress is on communication to the person receiving the advice.

In general, man's service of G-d should be characterized by both these thrusts. It must include service through his own ability, "an awakening from below," and influence he receives from above, "an awakening from above."

In greater detail, there are two types of influence from above itself: the influence which is granted according to the level of the person and therefore can become part of his inner being, and the influence which comes from a level which transcends the level of the person himself.

Similarly, these two dimensions are reflected in the motivators to the service of G-d which come from Jews themselves: "your judges", whose task is (to teach) Torah, the word of G-d -- give influence from a higher level than the person, and "your advisers" whose help can become part of one's inner self, in a way which makes him feel that it is for his own good.

Based on the above, we can understand why the connection between, "your judges" and the expression "in former times," and "your advisers" to "at the beginning." The difference between "in former times," and "at the beginning" is such: "In former times" alludes to a state of primeval existence, before the start of the matter, whilst "at the beginning" refers to the actual beginning of the matter.

Since the work of a judge reflects the issuing of dictates which comes as an order from above without taking into account the readiness of the recipient to receive them, there is consequently a gap (in quality, and therefore in time) between the pronouncement of the judge and its actual fulfillment. Because, after the ruling has been given, the judge has to start a new process -- the acceptance of his ruling and its fulfillment by the defendant -- the term "in former times" is used.

In contrast, the adviser's efforts focus on the recipient and is given with the thought of him in mind, that he be ready to accept the advice. Thus the actual giving of the advice shows that the process of communication has already started. The advice itself only reveals what is already there and shows how this advice is for his good. This also applies in time -- as immediately following the giving of the advice, there begins the process of its fulfillment. For this reason, the term "your advisers" employs the second person: emphasizes that it stresses that the advice belongs to you. Furthermore, through the efforts of "your advisers," the judges will become "your judges," their rulings, which of themselves are on a higher level than that of the litigants, will be accepted by them and internalized like advice.

This relates to the commandment of our Torah reading, "You shall appoint judges... in all your gates." The gate of a city is the opening through which one enters the city. This means that the appointment of judges (and officers -- when they are needed) should be in the manner of "you should appoint in all your gates" (second person) that the rulings of the judges -- who themselves may be aloof and separate -- should be accepted by the Jews, and should become part of "you" and even more so "in all your gates," i.e., internalized within the people.

We can now understand why after Mashiach comes, there will be no need for "officers." The judges and the advisers will be to perfection -- both the laws and rulings of the Torah which come with "your judges" together with the influence from above, as well as the good advice which comes through "your advisers" who allow this to be internalized into man's inner being. Through these two methods, a Jew will be completely permeated with Torah, mitzvos, and G-dliness so that "officers," representing force and compulsion, will no longer be necessary in order to carry out G-d's word.

Through "your judges" alone, the rulings of the Torah that a Jew accepts as a duty, because of a command and decree; the inner service which permeates his understanding and his feelings, which comes through "your advisers" is missing. Consequently, there remains room for the possibilities of the existence of a different and even opposite force within his inner being. Conversely, "advisers" alone are insufficient, for the power of the Torah and the infinite help which comes through the ruling of the judge is missing. Thus, it is through the fusion of both influences, that a complete level of service can be reached.

As a catalyst for the fulfillment of this prophecy, even before the Redemption, a Jew must perform a service according to his capabilities, that reflects -- and makes him a receptacle for -- the revelations of the Era of Mashiach. This means our service now should be on two motivating forces: a) that of "judges" -- fulfilling the rulings of the Torah as a duty, and b) that of "advisers" -- that the rulings of the Torah should be accepted by his inner self as good advice.

An illustration of the difference between the two functions mentioned above can be found in the contrast between the words of the Torah, and the words of prophecy, (both of which are mentioned in the Torah portion Shoftim).

Torah transcends the world, for it is the wisdom and will of G-d. Thus in the same way that one cannot grasp the being of G-d in any way, the real essence of the Torah is above our comprehension. Therefore the manner in which the Torah is conveyed to this world is mainly through commandments and rulings from above.

In contrast, prophecy -- even though it is the word of G-d, "the spirit of G-d spoke to me" -- is the revelation of G-dliness to man. "He revealed His secrets to His servants, the prophets", according to their limits that it should be absorbed in the knowledge and mind of the prophet. A prophet becomes as one with the prophecy communicated to him and the vision of prophecy becomes clothed in his minds and understanding and also in his thoughts and speech, as it is written "The spirit of G-d spoke in me, and His word is on my tongue."

Moreover, prophecy is intended to be revealed through speech. The very Hebrew term for prophecy, nevuah implies that it is a subject proclaimed and announced to the people as in the term niv s'fosayim, ("the expression of the lips"). In contrast, Torah can remain in one's thoughts. Also the import of prophecy has connection with the events of the world. To quote the Rambam, "A prophet is only there to inform us of what is going to happen in the future in the world."

Thus, the Torah and prophecy reflect the difference between "your judges" and "your advisers." The task of the judge is to rule on the laws of the Torah, which is done by way of command and decree. The adviser gives his advice "clothed" in language acceptable to the advised, which he can understand as does a prophet.

There is a commandment to obey "your judges" at all times, as it is written in our Torah portion "And you shall come... to the judge who will be in those days." Similarly, there is a commandment to obey the prophets, as it is written separately in the Torah portion "G-d will set up for you a prophet from your midst, from your brothers, like me, and you shall hearken to him."

In this context, the Rambam explains "one of the fundamentals of the religion is to know that G-d sends His prophecies through people." Since the Rambam prefaces the commandment to heed a prophet with the concept that prophecy is one of "the fundamentals of the religion," we can understand that this affects Jews in all generations.

We can now understand the uniqueness of the time in which we are living, an age when all the service required of us has been completed. From the time when the Torah commanded "You shall appoint judges and officers in all your gates," the fact that the Redemption did not come then served as a proof that the Jews had not completed the service required of them. Nevertheless, after the great amount of service throughout the generations, we are obviously very much nearer to the Redemption. Surely this has been enhanced by the revelation of P'nimiyus HaTorah, beginning from the AriZal's declaration that "it is a mitzvah to reveal this wisdom," and particularly through the service of the Rebbeim in spreading forth the wellsprings of Chassidus.

On a practical level, the injunction of "You shall appoint judges at all your gates," must be applied on several different levels. Firstly, "the gates" can be interpreted as referring to the seven gates of man: the two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and mouth. They should act according to the dictates of the Torah. On this level, the "judges" refer to the intellectual attributes of the G-dly soul and the "advisers," the emotional attributes. Thus every element of the life of a Jew has to be permeated and led by the G-dly power of his soul.

This concept should be extended and every man and woman should serve as a "judge" and an "adviser" in their household and family, insuring that it run according to the teachings and advice of the Torah. And to extend the concept even further, the whole world should follow the directives of the "judge" and the "adviser" of the generation.

We are now at the end of the year, in the month of Elul, which is the month of reckoning for the past year and the month of preparation for the next year. It is therefore an even more fitting time to make a true reckoning, and to undertake appropriate preparations for the next year in connection with the service described above. And this will bring each member of the Jewish people and the entire Jewish people as a whole, a kesivah vachasimah tovah, an inscription and the sealing of that inscription for a good and sweet year materially and spiritually. Included in this will be the fulfillment of the prophecy, "And I will return your judges as in former times, and your advisers as at the beginning," with the return of our people to Eretz Yisrael and to the Beis HaMikdash. May this take place in the immediate future.
