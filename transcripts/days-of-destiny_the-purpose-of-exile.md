# The Purpose of Exile

**Occasion:** Tishah BeAv

## Five Tragic Events Commemorated

The ninth of Av marks five catastrophes in Jewish history:

1. The decree that desert Jews could not enter the Land of Israel
2. Destruction of the First Temple by Babylonians
3. Destruction of the Second Temple by Romans
4. Devastation of Betar and massacre of its inhabitants
5. Ploughing under of the Temple and surroundings

## The Exile Serves a Spiritual Purpose

Rather than merely punishment, the exile enables spiritual achievement otherwise unattainable. As the Alter Rebbe taught, "Descent is for the purpose of ascent." Jewish people facing exile's tribulations while maintaining faith reach unprecedented spiritual heights -- comparable to how Egyptian slavery preceded greater spiritual wealth upon redemption.

The Yalkut Shimoni explains the destruction occurred "so that" reconstruction could follow, transforming "grief to happiness."

## How Redemption Arrives

According to Isaiah's prophecy, redemption comes through mishpat (Torah and its laws), tzedakah (charity), and tefillah (prayer). These three elements work together, with prayer serving as the vehicle elevating human service heavenward.

## Why Different Dates Were Predicted

Various sages predicted different redemption dates because each assessed how much spiritual accumulation Jews must achieve. Greater assessments require longer exile periods. The redemption arrives when the community reaches the necessary spiritual level.

## The Month's Dual Nature

The month's name -- Menachem Av (Comforting Father) -- grammatically means we comfort G-d, not vice versa. Since the Divine Presence also experiences exile, our spiritual work and good deeds comfort the Almighty while hastening redemption.
