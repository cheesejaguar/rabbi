Though Simchas Torah is the second day of Shemini Atzeres, it also has a unique aspect of its own. The Alter Rebbe writes in Tanya that "the name of an entity expresses its life force and nature." Thus, the fact that Simchas Torah has a name of its own implies that it represents a different entity than Shemini Atzeres.

In this, we see a difference between the diaspora and Eretz Yisroel where the holiday is only celebrated for one day. Nevertheless, since the celebration of the holiday in Eretz Yisroel cannot possibly lack anything, we are forced to say that there the qualities of both holidays are revealed on one day, while in the diaspora each one is revealed on a day of its own. Since time itself is also a creation, it follows that in the diaspora, added emphasis is placed on this quality for an entire day was created for Simchas Torah.

Simchas Torah is, as implied by its name, a celebration associated with the Torah, in particular, the giving of the second tablets. Though they were given on Yom Kippur, our celebration is held on Simchas Torah. The essence of this day is that the highest aspects of the Torah are revealed within the contexts of our world.

The Torah existed two thousand years before the world. After the world's creation, we find that Adam studied Torah in Gan Eden. Rashi (Genesis 2:15) explains that he was charged with the performance of both the positive and negative commandments. It is self-understood that unless he studied Torah, he would not have been able to perform those commandments.

Furthermore, we can conclude that he also studied Pnimiyus HaTorah (Torah's mystic realm). This is obvious from his naming of all the creations. The Midrash relates that G-d told the angels that Adam's wisdom exceeded theirs as proven by the fact that he was able to name all the animals. The Maggid explains that Adam comprehended the life-force and nature of each animal and therefore, was able to give each one a name that was representative of that life-force.

This comprehension stemmed from Pnimiyus HaTorah. Since G-d "looked into the Torah and created the world," by looking into Pnimiyus HaTorah, one can appreciate the inner life-force of all the creations, the source and their root.

This was true before the giving of the Torah. At the giving of the Torah, Torah, including Pnimiyus HaTorah, was revealed within the context of this world. This is implied by our Sages who explained that before the giving of the Torah, there was a separation between the spiritual and the material and, with the giving of the Torah, that gap was bridged and Torah could be revealed within the context of our world.

The giving of the second tablets represented an even higher revelation. Our Sages associated G-d's granting of them with the verse (Iyov 11:6): "A hidden wisdom, for they are two-fold..." Thus, they included a "two-fold" revelation, i.e., an increase of Torah knowledge including "hidden wisdom," Pnimiyus HaTorah. Furthermore, since the giving of the second tablets was preceded by the service of teshuvah, its effect within our world is emphasized more.

The revelation of the highest aspects of the Torah within the context of our world on Simchas Torah is further emphasized by the Zohar which associates Simchas Torah with Kesser Torah, "the crown of the Torah," the aspect of Torah which transcends intellect.

This quality is also associated with the study of practical Halachah which is also described (Megillah 28b) as "Kesser Torah." In the Torah's halachos, we find the above qualities, the revelation of the highest qualities, G-d's will which transcends wisdom, and the expression of that will within the context of our world.

The latter quality is further emphasized by the fact that the study of the Torah's halachos is applicable to every Jew. The relation of a person to the theoretical aspects of Torah study depends on his individual abilities. Even though the entire Torah was given as an inheritance to every Jew, each person's ability to comprehend Torah differs. However, these variances do not apply in regard to Halachah. In that realm, every Jew, man or woman, is equal.

Even though in certain aspects, Shemini Atzeres and Simchas Torah are considered as a separate holiday, in other contexts, they are considered as an extension of Sukkos. This is implied by the very name Shemini Atzeres, "the eighth day of assembly."

The Rashba explains the significance of the number eight as follows. Seven refers to the perfection of the natural order. Eight refers to a revelation above the natural order which "protects" the natural order. Our Sages associate the number seven with seven mitzvos of Sukkos -- the four species in the lulav, the sukkah, the chagigah sacrifice, and the celebration associated with the water libation.

In particular, we can see seven levels of happiness:

In relation to creation: a) the happiness which stems from being G-d's creation; b) the happiness associated with being created in a manner representative of the Creator; c) the happiness connected with the creation of a special time for joy, the season of our rejoicing.

In addition, there are four other sources of happiness for Jews: d) the happiness that stems from the ability to serve G-d; e) the happiness which results from fulfilling the command to "serve the L-rd, your G-d, with joy;" f) the additional happiness that accompanies the mitzvos directly associated with joy which include all the holidays; g) the particular happiness associated with Sukkos, "the season of our rejoicing."

Shemini Atzeres represents an eighth level of happiness, an even higher and more elevated level.

Despite all the heights reached in the celebration of Sukkos -- including the celebration of Simchas Bais Hashoevah concerning which it is said: "Whoever did not witness Simchas Bais Hashoevah never witnessed simchah in his life" -- still left a degree of separation among the Jewish people. Thus, we find that at the Simchas Bais Hashoevah celebrations, the actual celebration was only carried out by the Sages and the pious, while the common people would stand and watch.

In contrast, on Simchas Torah, we see all Jews dancing together with the Torah without any differentiation between them. All dance as equals. This is further brought out with the practice of dancing with the Torah while it is closed and covered with a mantle. While the Torah is held in this manner, it cannot be studied. This emphasizes that the happiness is not connected with the appreciation of wisdom of the Torah -- where divisions exist between the scholars and others -- but with the essence of the Torah. On that level, all Jews are equal.

The celebration of Shemini Atzeres has its source in the Torah itself, while Simchas Torah is only a Rabbinic decree. From a certain perspective, a commandment mentioned specifically in the Torah has an added strength and power. However, from a different standpoint, there is an advantage to Rabbinic commandments as our Sages said, "The Rabbinic decrees are more precious (alternatively, 'more powerful') for Me." They represent concepts that are too high to be expressed within the Torah.

The Jewish people's ability to bring out the practices mentioned in the oral law and in Jewish custom reveals the ultimately high source of the Jewish soul; how it supercedes even the Torah itself. This concept is expressed by Tanna D'Bei Eliyahu:

Two entities preceded the world: Torah and the Jews. I would not know which came first. However, since the Torah says: "Command the children of Israel," "Speak to the children of Israel," I may presume that Israel comes first.

Since the Jews preceded the Torah, they have the power to bring out new concepts in Torah and to add to the Torah, thus, creating the oral law and Jewish custom. The latter express the power of the Jewish people which transcends the Torah.

This aspect is emphasized on Simchas Torah when we dance with the Torah as it is covered in its mantle. When the Torah is opened and studied, we appreciate how the Torah effects the Jewish people. When it is closed, we see how the Jews can effect the Torah and bring it joy, allowing the Torah to rejoice to the extent that when a Jew holds the Torah and dances, the Torah dances with him. The Jew's ability to do this stems from their source which is above that of the Torah.

Deed is most essential. In this case, this means adding to the celebrations of Sukkos and Shemini Atzeres and dancing with unbounded and unlimited happiness and joy. As explained in the previous days, this dancing must also spread into the street.

According to the Previous Rebbe, the time to review the portion of V'Zos HaBerachah is on Shemini Atzeres. Accordingly, since it is customary to explain a verse from the weekly portion according to Rashi's commentary, it is appropriate to explain a point from Rashi's commentary at present.

The point chosen is Rashi's commentary on the final words of the Torah, "before the eyes of all Israel." Rashi explains that this refers to Moshe's act of breaking the tablets:

His heart was inspired to break the tablets before their eyes as it is said, "I broke them before their eyes." The Holy One, Blessed be He, agreed with him as can be inferred by the phrase "which you broke." [The Hebrew word for "which," asher, also has the implication of happiness. Thus, G-d's words can be interpreted:] "Praise to you for breaking them."

Why does the concluding phrase of the Torah deal with breaking the tablets? And why is this considered Moshe's greatest virtue?

Moshe understood the importance of each Jew. He appreciated that the Torah only exists for the sake of the Jews and therefore, when there was a possibility that harm could befall a Jew, Moshe did not hesitate, nor did he consult anyone, even G-d, Himself. Rather, he was willing to break these tablets for the sake of the Jewish people.

Furthermore, the entire Jewish people were not in danger. G-d knew that only a small amount sinned and those being the lowest of the people. Nevertheless, in order to protect these individuals Moshe was willing to break the tablets fashioned by G-d, Himself.

Thus, we can see how the breaking of the tablets is considered Moshe's greatest act of virtue. It shows how he was willing to give up the Torah, the most important aspect of his life in order to save a Jew who sinned by serving the golden calf. This represents the true virtue of a Jewish leader who recognizes the essential nature of every Jewish soul and, hence, is willing to sacrifice everything for him.

This is truly Moshe's greatest quality. All of his other virtues were given to him by G-d. Indeed, because he appreciated that these virtues were G-d-given gifts, Moshe thought nothing of them and considered himself "humbler than any person on the face of the earth." However, the willingness to sacrifice everything for a single Jew was a quality Moshe achieved on his own accord and "G-d agreed with him."

May the redemption come immediately and then, we will continue the farbrengen, and afterwards Hakafos, together with Moshiach in the city of Jerusalem.
