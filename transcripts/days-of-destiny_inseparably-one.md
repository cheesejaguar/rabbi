# Inseparably One

**Occasion:** 17th of Tammuz
**Source:** Days of Destiny, Sichos In English

---

The seventeenth of Tammuz is a public fast commemorating five tragic events that occurred on that day:

1. Moshe Rabbeinu broke the tablets with the Ten Commandments upon descending from Mt. Sinai and witnessing Jews worshipping a golden calf.

2. The daily offering was discontinued in the first Beis HaMikdosh because Jerusalem was under siege and obtaining necessary animals became impossible.

3. The wall around Yerushalayim was breached by enemies during the second Beis HaMikdosh period.

4. Apostomos burnt the Torah.

5. An idol was placed in the Beis HaMikdosh.

## Fast Day as Inspiration for Repentance

A fast serves primarily to eliminate tragedy through spiritual means. According to Jewish understanding, "evil befalls Jews only because they have sinned." Fasts function as reminders and catalysts for repentance, drawing individuals closer to G-d during times when "the L-rd...may be found" and "is near to all Jews."

## The Significance of the Broken Tablets

The tablets' tragedy lies not merely in losing written information, as Jews had already received Torah portions and heard the Ten Commandments forty days earlier. Rather, the engraved letters on stone represented something fundamentally different from written ink on paper. Engraved letters become inseparable from their medium, whereas written letters remain removable.

This distinction symbolizes how Torah becomes etched into a Jew's very soul. The text explains: "The Commandments would be engraved in a Jew's soul, a part of him, one with his essence." All 613 mitzvos encompass within the Ten Commandments, meaning the entire Torah is eternally part of every Jew's spiritual makeup.

The breaking of tablets symbolizes the danger of viewing Judaism and Jews as separate entities rather than inseparably unified. A Jew cannot truly remove himself from Judaism, though he may attempt hiding from observance. "Judaism is part of him, etched in his soul, unremovable."

## The Breached Wall Around Jerusalem

The wall surrounding Jerusalem represents protective measures -- extra care in performing mitzvos and preventative enactments against sin. These are safeguards rather than core principles. Spiritually, while the wall's breach initially seems minor since the city and Beis HaMikdosh remain intact, it signals danger.

The breach demonstrates how one transgression leads to another. Neglecting even protective measures compromises Judaism itself. Every element of Judaism affects Jewish existence since all Torah aspects are engraved in the soul. The lesson teaches that all aspects of Judaism -- not just foundational principles -- are vitally important.

## Purpose of Fasting

Fasting minimizes physical involvement, reducing "fat and blood," representing pleasure and excitement. Through spiritual service during fasts, Jews rectify past transgressions causing the commemorated events.

The text notes that in the Messianic era, these fasts will transform into festivals, as written: "the fast of the fourth...and the fast of the tenth shall become times of gladness, joy, and festivals."
