The final two days of Pesach address distinct themes. The Seventh Day commemorates the redemption from Egypt and the parting of the sea. Acharon Shel Pesach, by contrast, focuses on future redemption and Moshiach's arrival. The Messianic Age encompasses two phases: initially, the world operates much as it does presently, but the second phase involves a complete transformation of the natural order, including resurrection of the dead.

These two stages appear in the observance of Acharon Shel Pesach. The Haftorah extensively discusses Moshiach, describing: "A shoot shall come forth from the stem of Yishai, and a branch shall grow forth out of his roots," reflecting the first phase.

Additionally, "Moshiach's Seudah," established by the Baal Shem Tov and later expanded by the Rebbe Rashab to include four cups of wine, represents the second phase. This dedicated time specifically addressing Moshiach marks this elevation.

Even the initial stage surpasses natural order. The Haftorah verse states: "The L-rd will dry up the gulf of the Egyptian sea, lift His hand over the River [Euphrates] in His mighty wind and smite it into seven streams, and cause men to cross over in shoes." The phrase "over the River" suggests a revelation transcending natural forces.

This revelation was foreseen at creation. The Midrash comments on Genesis 1:2, "And the spirit of G-d was hovering over the waters," interpreting this as "the spirit of Moshiach." The phrase "over the waters" alludes to this same revelation.

However, there exists an even higher revelation: the ability to speak of being "over the river" and "over the waters" indicates a level still connected to the waters themselves. This demonstrates it remains somewhat within nature's framework.

The ultimate level completely transcends nature -- so much so that it cannot be described as being "over" it. The Shabbos Chol HaMoed Pesach Haftorah addresses this through the "dry bones" and Resurrection of the Dead, stating: "the spirit [of life] came into them, they came alive and stood up on their feet, a very, very (me'od, me'od) great multitude." This doubled expression indicates a level surpassing not only nature itself but even higher revelation levels.

As noted, Moshiach's ultimate arrival was predetermined at creation. All descents and negative occurrences since -- including the Sin of the Tree of Knowledge and successive exiles from Egypt onward -- serve later ascent. The world will not merely return to its original holy state but attain an even greater level in two respects: first, a higher and more revealed Divine revelation than existed at creation's beginning; second, this holiness will permeate the physical world and all objects within it.

This receives allusion in Psalms 66:6: "He changed the sea into dry land; through the river they passed in shoes." An obvious question emerges: why would shoes be necessary under such conditions? Currently, shoes protect feet from dangerous objects. In the Messianic Age, when negative forces vanish, such protection seems unnecessary.

The explanation reveals that shoes then will serve solely to elevate the shoes themselves. Thus the Divine revelation transcending creation will penetrate and transform the physical world into holiness.

Since, as Rashi notes, the world was created for the Jewish people, we observe the same progression pattern in individuals as in the world generally. There is descent, as the soul descends from its holy source to join a physical body and animal soul -- described as descending "from a high mountain to a deep pit."

However, this descent's original purpose was enabling later elevation beyond the soul's original state. Although the soul was previously united with G-d's essence, it achieves elevation through worldly descent, becoming completely one with Him to the point where hierarchical levels cease applying -- the soul becomes part of His essence. Therefore, as the world transforms its descent into Messianic ascent, the soul undergoes this identical process.

The Alter Rebbe explains in Tanya that the Messianic Age's perfection depends on our G-d service during exile. This indicates our service accomplishes this perfection presently; revelation merely awaits Moshiach's days. The Rebbe Maharash compared it to a wealthy person with hidden chest wealth. Though unable to see it, it exists and will later be revealed. Similarly, our Torah and mitzvos have already accomplished everything; we will only perceive it when Moshiach arrives.

Actually, the revelation itself lies within our hands. Using the analogy: the rich person also possesses the chest key and can open it whenever desired. We similarly have the key, possessing the capability to bring Moshiach. As the Alter Rebbe quotes from Tikkunim, if even one tzaddik performed complete teshuvah, Moshiach would come. Halachah contains a similar concept -- the Rambam rules that even one additional mitzvah by one individual possesses power to bring Moshiach.

Therefore, Tomchei Temimim should distribute wine to all who have not yet completed four cups. The wine should produce its effect: generating physical joy leading to singing, clapping, and dancing.

[After the Sicha, Tomchei Temimim administration distributed wine, and during singing, the Rebbe stood up and danced with tremendous joy.]

Pesach closely associates with children's education, evident from the Seder. Many practices change to maintain children's alertness; they are encouraged to ask numerous questions. This occurs specifically on Pesach because, as Prophet Yechezkel stated, Pesach represents the Jewish people's birth.

The Haggadah mentions four sons: the wise son, the wicked son, the simple son, and the one unable to ask. The last presents particular difficulty, for even the wicked son participates in the Seder with enough interest to pose questions. His problematic state receives allusion in Haggadah instructions: "You (at, the feminine form) must initiate him." The feminine form indicates weakness -- specifically his teacher's weakness. Without this, he would not be unable to ask. This child's severe need means one must invest extra educational effort.

This teaches a general educational principle: even when efforts appear fruitless, one must not lose hope. Rather, one should intensify efforts.

All Pesach days form a single unit. The educational emphasis visible in Pesach's early days must extend through the final days. However, the educational content differs somewhat. Early days primarily teach children about Egyptian exile and redemption. Final days must address Moshiach.

Moshiach education must include teaching children to eagerly await and request his arrival. It also includes, naturally, avoiding things preventing his coming.

It is customary to discuss a topic for the Kinus Torah (Torah conference) the day after Yom Tov. Regarding the aforementioned, it is curious that chinuch (children's education) is not counted as a Biblical law but only as a Rabbinic obligation. Chinuch is absolutely vital and is even commanded in Proverbs: "Educate the child according to his way"; why should it not be Biblically required?

The explanation appears to run as follows: since the child has not yet reached obligation age for mitzvos, there is no Biblical requirement whatsoever. It compares to a convert situation: before actually converting, there is no mitzvah obligation.

Therefore, similarly, there is no Biblical chinuch obligation since the child has not yet reached the proper age. But ultimately, there remains a Rabbinic command to educate children and prepare them to fulfill mitzvos upon reaching responsibility age. As explained in Chassidus, the word mitzvah associates with tzavsa, meaning "connection," since through performing a mitzvah one connects with G-d.

As mentioned above, Acharon Shel Pesach associates with Moshiach. This year receives added emphasis as it falls on Tuesday, the week's third day. The number three signifies completion, particularly the third Bais HaMikdash's building.

Upon reflection, we realize we have been given extra strength to bring about redemption. It remains up to us to utilize this strength properly through making firm future resolutions and then executing them in reality.

We previously mentioned that every dwelling should become a "miniature sanctuary." This obviously applies much more to dwellings in Yerushalayim itself.

Therefore, it is proper for all Jews to participate in building dwellings in Yerushalayim for Jews from Russia who will soon come out. Those already appointed to head this project should do so with great haste and energy, making this their main life focus from now on.

May we merit that this be the Acharon Shel Pesach Ha'Acharon (the last one) spent in exile; and that we spend next year in Yerushalayim. As the Rebbe, my father-in-law explained, this does not mean we should wait until next year. Rather, let Moshiach come immediately and automatically we will spend next year in Yerushalayim.

[The Rebbe gave out matzah to Professor Branover and Rabbi Medanchik. He then began singing the Hakkafos niggun from his father, and then stood up again and danced with tremendous joy.]
