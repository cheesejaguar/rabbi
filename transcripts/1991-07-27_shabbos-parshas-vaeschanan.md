**Date:** July 27, 1991 (16th Day of Menachem Av, 5751)
**Occasion:** Shabbos Parshas Vaeschanan -- Shabbos Nachamu
**Source:** Sichos In English, Volume 49

---

This sicho discusses connections between the Torah portion Vaeschanan and its corresponding Haftorah reading "Nachamu, Nachamu" (Take comfort, take comfort).

## The Concept of Repetition and Redemption

The text explains that exact repetition, as seen in "Nachamu, Nachamu," expresses infinite dimensions associated with the Final Redemption. As stated, "the repetition is exact, it is clear that the only purpose is to express the infinite dimension associated with redemption."

## The Three Batei HaMikdash

Each of the three Temples possessed distinct qualities. The First represented revelation from Above; the Second showed advantages in duration and size; the Third will combine both aspects with unique characteristics.

## The Fifteenth of Av

This day marks the full moon, representing completeness in Jewish service. The text notes connections between preparation on Friday and spiritual benefit on Shabbos, with emphasis on increased Torah study during this period.

## Contemporary Context

The sicho references a Convention of Shluchim in Russia and emphasizes studying topics related to redemption, particularly Hilchos Melachim and Hilchos Beis HaBechirah.

## Pirkei Avos Connection

The teaching links the third chapter of Pirkei Avos with the Third Beis HaMikdash and redemption themes.
