## Section 1: The Lesson of Parshas Yisro

The Alter Rebbe taught that we should live according to the lessons of each weekly Torah portion. This week's portion, Yisro, describes the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, with the Haftorah emphasizing Isaiah's vision of the Divine Chariot.

### Three Annual Readings of Torah's Giving

The Torah's giving is described three times yearly:
- Parshas Yisro (regular reading)
- Shavuos (festival observance)
- Parshas Vaeschanan (after the Three Weeks of mourning)

Each reading carries distinct significance based on its timing and spiritual context.

On Shavuos, as a festival day, "a good day" characterized by rejoicing, the giving of the Torah is celebrated with festive solemnity and special observances.

Parshas Yisro describes events before the Torah's giving, when the Jewish people existed at the spiritual level of Tzaddikim (the righteous), before the sin of the golden calf.

Parshas Vaeschanan, by contrast, describes the service of Ba'alei Teshuvah (those doing repentance) following the golden calf sin, representing the giving of the second tablets.

### The Nature of Torah Study

The first tablets were given with "thunder and lightening," accompanied by noise and commotion. Our sages declared that "just as there (at Mt. Sinai), there was awe and fear, trembling and sweating, so now (in our Torah study) there must also be awe and fear, trembling and sweating."

Though contemporary Torah study lacks the open miracles present at Sinai, the reverent approach must remain constant since the Torah studied is G-d's Torah.

The Tanya teaches that Torah must "rest within all 248 limbs of the body." Though Torah is intellectual study requiring peace of mind and bodily calm, it must also permeate one's entire being. A Talmudic account describes Rava becoming so absorbed in study that he ground his fingers until they bled -- demonstrating total involvement with learning.

### Spreading Torah with Enthusiasm

An important lesson emerges: spreading Torah, particularly the wellsprings of Chassidus, must be done with "noise," excitement, and commotion. One might argue that "the words of the wise are heard with quiet," suggesting careful, gradual approaches.

However, this contradicts the approach of the Previous Rebbe, who stressed immediate action. He noted we have only "few moments" before Mashiach's arrival and urged us to "grab and eat, grab and drink," utilizing every moment to create great commotion for Torah. This applies not only to holidays but to weekdays as well -- hence Parshas Yisro is read during regular weeks, not exclusively on Shavuos.

### Addressing the "Evil Eye" Concern

The Midrash indicates that Mt. Sinai's noise brought "the influence of the evil eye." How can we then demand noise in spreading Torah?

The answer lies in understanding the sin of the tree of knowledge. The Midrash explains Adam's sin occurred through eating at the wrong time. Had he waited three hours, he could have made wine for Kiddush -- making consumption of the fruit a positive act. Timing determines whether an action is negative or constructive.

Similarly, noise accompanying Torah spreading is necessary and positive in our current era. We must learn and spread Torah, especially Chassidus teachings, with excitement and energy.

Those objecting that only Tzaddikim should engage in such noise, not Ba'alei Teshuvah, should remember Isaiah's declaration: "Your nation are all Tzaddikim." The Torah's spread through enthusiasm should reach not only known individuals but even those with no prior connection.

### Maintaining Proper Perspective

Care must be taken against deriving false pride or egotism from such activities. When others accomplish valuable work, one must not react negatively. The task requires true unity, approaching Torah's spread with enthusiasm through joint effort and shared goals. These endeavors will "hasten the revelation of the third Temple" with Mashiach's arrival.

## Section 2: Connection to the Previous Rebbe's Yahrzeit

Parshas Yisro is read in weeks following the Previous Rebbe's death anniversary (Yud Shvat). This year marks the thirtieth anniversary, creating special significance.

### The Previous Rebbe's Sacrifice

The Midrash states the Torah is called "the Torah of Moshe" because he sacrificed his soul for it. Similarly, the Previous Rebbe sacrificed himself for Torah and Mitzvos -- not merely body and animal soul, but even his Divine soul. He sent others to sacrifice their lives, requiring even greater self-sacrifice.

Some Rabbis maintained one's life need not be sacrificed, as the Russian government didn't demand murder, adultery, or idol worship. Yet the Previous Rebbe willingly risked imprisonment, knowing it would prevent certain Mitzvah observance, continuing his efforts unceasingly.

### Ongoing Spiritual Legacy

Each year since his passing, "a new light...higher than any light that has descended until now is revealed," enhancing the impact of his service. This thirtieth anniversary year should generate new breakthroughs in spreading Torah and Chassidus.

### The Thirty-Year Principle

The Baal Shem Tov's commentary on the Mishnah teaching "Reflect upon three things...before whom you are destined to give a judgment" explains that before a Jew faces judgment, he judges another in similar circumstances; that same judgment then applies to himself.

The Previous Rebbe declared regarding his liberation (Yud-Bais Tammuz) that "G-d did not redeem me alone" but all Jewish people, even the most distant in commitment. He wrote of his father that "a shepherd of Israel will not leave the sheep of his pasture." These principles now apply to the Previous Rebbe himself.

The Talmud states Moshe Rabbeinu, thousands of years after death, remains "standing and serving" the Jewish people as during his lifetime. The same applies to the Previous Rebbe.

**The Mishnah declares "At thirty -- one achieves strength."** One might assume that thirty years after the Rebbe's passing, Jews can stand independently. The answer is no: "a shepherd will never leave his flock." The connection remains as strong as immediately after his passing. Jews must "hold fast to his doorknob," especially his open door -- visiting his grave, writing Pidyonos (blessing requests), asking for mercy and blessing.

### Practical Application

When approaching a Jew during business hours urging Torah study, if he claims circumstances prevent it, one should remind him that the Previous Rebbe -- the Nasi (leader) of the generation -- asks this of him. All can take courage from the Previous Rebbe's devotion to Torah study despite severe persecution.

The promise that "those who lie in dust will arise and sing" will be fulfilled with his coming, bringing Mashiach speedily in our days.
