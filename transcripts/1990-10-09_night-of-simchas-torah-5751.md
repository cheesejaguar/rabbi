Simchas Torah represents the ultimate expression of happiness. The holidays are described as "festivals for rejoicing," with Sukkos specifically called "the season of our rejoicing." After seven days of Sukkos celebration, one must reach an elevated level of happiness on Shemini Atzeres.

This year is particularly significant as "a year when, 'I will show you wonders,'" exceeding the previous year which was "a year of miracles." This transcendence has been demonstrated through remarkable events in Eretz Yisrael that benefited the Jewish people, though initially they appeared concerning.

The text notes that while some miracles occur without the recipient recognizing them, the present miracles have been openly revealed. These miracles are enclothed within the natural order and connected with gentile nations' conduct, contrasting with the purely spiritual nature of Chanukah's miracle versus Purim's material-world miracle. This integration explains why "the happiness of Purim is greater."

The happiness should extend to children of both genders, as they can teach adults through their participation. The Rebbe referenced how a young girl's singing and dancing at a Simchas Torah celebration influenced many observers.

This happiness, originating from Simchas Beis HaShoevah celebrations that "made the street dance" in Crown Heights and spread elsewhere, should ultimately lead to redemption in Jerusalem and the Beis HaMikdash, culminating in the Messianic age when "G-d will 'make a dance for the righteous.'"

It is customary to explain the verses of Atah Horaisa, which serve similarly to how Malchiyos, Zichronos, and Shofros verses provide Torah proof regarding Rosh HaShanah service. The Chabad custom involves reciting these verses three times across three occasions: Shemini Atzeres night, Simchas Torah night, and Simchas Torah day.

Atah Horaisa means "You," referring to G-d's essence, which is revealed so people will know Him. Despite being "above all of G-d's names," this essence becomes accessible so that "all, even young children appreciate G-d's essence."

The phrase "The L-rd is G-d" (Y-H-V-H is E-lohim) means that G-d's essential name is revealed within creation. "There is none else aside from Him" reflects that "G-d's essence can be revealed within our material reality."

The verses progress through several themes:

- G-d's "kindness [is extended] to the world" and can be "perceived by human intellect"
- G-d "rejoices" in His works, relating to Simchas Torah's happiness
- G-d's "blessed" (extended) name continues forever
- G-d's presence with the Jewish people, with the promise "He will not forsake us or abandon us"
- The ultimate gathering of exiles in the Messianic age
- "The L-rd is King; the L-rd was King, the L-rd will be King forever and ever"
- G-d granting strength to receive Messianic blessings through peace

The verses emphasize that achievements come through effort -- wherever a Jew travels, "the ark which contains the Torah in which G-d invested Himself accompanies him." This represents the progression from exile toward redemption.

The text references priestly righteousness, David's kingship ("David, the King of Israel, is living and enduring"), and the Messianic revelation when people will declare "This is our G-d" with open happiness rather than the "rejoicing in trembling" characteristic of Rosh HaShanah service.

The final verses emphasize that through Jewish service, G-d's "Kingship" achieves willing acceptance of His will across all generations. The ultimate fulfillment arrives when "From Zion shall go forth the Torah; and the word of L-rd from Jerusalem," when every Jew celebrates by dancing with G-d's essence, "Israel and their king alone."
