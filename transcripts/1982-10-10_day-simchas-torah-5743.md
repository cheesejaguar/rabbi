1. Chassidus explains that the festival of Sukkos emphasizes the idea of unity. Since Shemini Atzeres (and Simchas Torah -- which is the second day of Shemini Atzeres), although a separate festival, is also a continuation of Sukkos, the idea of unity is also found therein. However, on Shemini Atzeres the ideas of Sukkos are expressed in their inner content, and thus unity is expressed more emphatically on Shemini Atzeres. We find that its offerings are "one bullock" and "one ram," unlike the seven days of Sukkos when 70 bullocks are offered. The Talmud explains that the 70 bullocks offered on Sukkos correspond to the seventy nations, whereas the one bullock on Shemini Atzeres corresponds to "the one people."

The idea of unity on Shemini Atzeres expresses the essence of Jews -- "one people on the earth." Although on the "earth" (corresponding to division and separateness), they are still "one people." Thus, when Jews are on the "earth," they are as "guests" -- for since their true essence is unity, oneness, the "land" (division) is not their true place.

An illustration of this concept is found in a story about the Maggid related by the previous Rebbe. The Maggid had hardly any furniture, and the little he had was simple in the extreme. When a guest commented that the furniture in his (the guest's) home was much more luxurious, the Maggid agreed and said "In the home it is completely different." When a person leaves his home on business, he makes do with little, knowing it is not his home, and he is only a "guest" wherever he stays. This is what the Maggid meant when he said "In the home it is completely different." A Jew must know that he is only a "guest" in this physical world, and therefore he should not chase after and desire material possessions.

In greater clarification: This physical world is not a Jew's "home;" he is here only as a "guest" who comes to engage in "business." Just as a businessman spends and invests money to earn more money, so too the soul descends into this world for the purpose of thereby gaining an elevation to a level higher than before its descent. In the future to come, however, there will be no more "business," and then Jews will be in their true place, their home -- and not "guests" who come for business.

Although, through Jews' service, this world is made into a dwelling place for G-d -- and therefore it does become the true home of a Jew -- this is only after the completion of the work, when the promise "the glory of the L-rd will be revealed and all flesh together shall see that the mouth of the L-rd has spoken" will be fulfilled. But before the completion of this service, this physical world is still a "deep pit" -- and is therefore not a Jew's true home.

Of course, this in no way contradicts the idea of serving G-d with joy. The Rebbe Maharash explains that all the lofty things that will be revealed in the future come about through man's service now. Thus a person's service in the "deep pit" is with great joy, knowing that he is effecting the revelations of the future. Moreover, a Jew has the ability not only to effect the revelations of the future, but to reveal those matters right now. It is recorded in Zohar that if even one tzaddik would do complete teshuvah, Moshiach comes in his generation. Since teshuvah can be done in a moment, it follows that a person can bring Moshiach in a moment -- and thereby reveal all the revelations of the future.

Although a Jew is a "guest" in this physical world, G-d must still give him all his material needs generously. For since a Jew is in this world on G-d's mission, G-d must provide him with everything necessary for its fulfillment.

We see this from a mishnah concerning the obligation to supply food to workers engaged for a job. The mishnah states that "even if you should prepare for them a banquet like Shlomo's in his glory, you have not fulfilled your obligation to them, for they are children of Avraham, Yitzchok and Ya'akov." Certainly then, in our case, when we are talking of an agent of G-d -- and even more, a son of G-d -- G-d certainly must give him all his material needs in ample measure.

2. It is a custom of the Rebbeim to explain the verses of "Ata Horaysa" that are said before Hakofos. The first verse is "You have shown to know that the L-rd is G-d, there is none else aside from Him." We have explained this verse in previous years in different ways, and this year, since it is the 100th year of the Rebbe Maharash's Yartzeit, we will explain it consonant to his famous dictum "lechatchilah ariber" -- one must always aim directly for the top, transcending all difficulties.

The Alter Rebbe explains that "You" (in our verse "You have shown") is direct tense, referring to the Essence of G-d. "You" implies direct revelation, such that a person can turn to the subject and speak directly to him. This term cannot be applied to the different levels of G-dliness, for since there are differences in the amount of revelation and concealment of G-d, even the revelation that does exist is not in such full strength that one can say of it "You." Only of the Essence of G-d, in which there are no differences in regard to revelation and concealment, one can say "You."

That is why the word "You," the beginning of the 17 verses of Ata Horaysa, is the idea of "lechatchilah ariber." We do not start the verses from the lowest level and work up, but from the top -- "You," G-d's Essence, the highest level.

Even the revelation of G-d's Essence is in the manner of "lechatchilah ariber" -- "You have shown to know." G-d's Essence could have been revealed in various ways -- through contemplation, faith etc. This verse teaches that it is revealed through seeing -- "You have shown." That is, G-d has shown His Essence to us. And this revelation through seeing affects all of man's other faculties -- the ten soul powers, thought, speech and deed, his limbs etc. Thus the verse states "You have shown to know." "Knowledge" ("daas") means knowing something with absolute firmness; and since knowledge is the key to all of the other soul powers, the revelation of G-d's Essence reaches them too.

The verse then continues "that the L-rd is G-d." "L-rd" ("Havayah") and "G-d" ("Elokim") are two different levels in the revelation of G-dliness. "L-rd" refers to G-dliness transcending nature, and "G-d" to G-dliness as it is immanent in nature.

These too are in the manner of "lechatchilah ariber." The levels of L-rd and G-d are revealed ("You have shown to know") to be one thing -- "the L-rd is G-d." This verse does not talk of L-rd and G-d as two different methods of revealing G-dliness, but starts from the top -- they are one.

Not only does the idea of "lechatchilah ariber" apply to the revelation of G-dliness in the world ("the L-rd is G-d"), but also to the world itself as alluded in the continuation of the verse "there is none else." "There is none else" is paradoxical. The very fact that we find it necessary to say "there is none else" indicates there could be something else -- and simultaneously we say "there is none else." It is only the revelation of "You have shown to know" ("lechatchilah ariber") which tells us that there is no possibility of anything else.

Further still, the verse states: "There is none else aside from Him." "There is none else" says that there is only G-d -- the world is not a (true) existence. "There is none else aside from Him" means there is no (true) existence "aside from Him" -- but together with Him there is the existence of the world. That is, the existence of the world is G-dliness. The world is not just an illusion, for the fact that mitzvos are performed with physical objects proves the world truly exists. That existence, however, is G-dliness.

This paradox is the idea of "lechatchilah ariber." That two opposites can simultaneously co-exist is a very novel concept. Their synthesis is only possible because of G-d's Essence. It is only when we start from G-d's Essence "lechatchilah ariber," that its revelation can be in the manner of "there is none else aside from Him" -- the synthesis of two opposites.

3. Simchas Torah is an appropriate time to once again remind and urge everyone to participate in the Torah campaign -- to increase, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in Torah study. On Simchas Torah every Jew is given the strength to learn more than before.

It is likewise the appropriate time to urge everyone to ensure that all Jews acquire a letter in one of the Sifrei Torah being written to unite all Jewry. Through this all Jews are united into one entity, similar to the "one Torah."

4. On Simchas Torah, after we finish reading the conclusion of the entire Torah, we start reading from the beginning -- "In the beginning G-d created the heavens and the earth." The purpose of a soul's descent into this world is to elevate the world through the fulfillment of Torah and mitzvos. We can therefore not allow any break of our Torah study. Hence, when we finish reading the Torah on Simchas Torah, we immediately begin it again.

"Tzaddikim are like their Creator." G-d created the world through the Torah, as stated: "He looked into the Torah and created the world." Jews, too, through learning the verse "In the beginning G-d created the heavens and the earth," effect the creation of the world anew. Since "Whoever reads and learns Torah, G-d reads and learns opposite him," when a Jew reads that "In the beginning G-d created the heavens and the earth," G-d reads the same thing "opposite him" -- and since G-d's words are as deeds, the world is created anew. And since "one rises in holiness," the creation is in loftier fashion.

5. Simchas Torah, as its name indicates, is the rejoicing with the Torah. However, the Torah was given to Jews on the festival of Shavuos. Why then is not Simchas Torah on Shavuos?

Chassidus explains that the joy of Simchas Torah is associated with Yom Kippur, when the second set of tablets were given; Shavuos is associated with the first set of tablets. The first set correspond to the service of tzaddikim, the perfectly righteous; the second to the service of baalei teshuvah, penitents.

It is because the second set of tablets is associated with teshuvah that it has many things not present in the first tablets. The Talmud states that "If not for the fact that the Jews sinned, they would have been given only the five books of the Torah and the book of Yehoshua." Likewise, the Midrash states that when Moshe Rabbeinu was distressed over the breaking of the first tablets, "G-d said to him, do not be distressed over the first tablets, for they only contained the Ten Commandments; but the second tablets I shall give you will contain Halachos, Midrash and Aggados -- double strength."

The advantage of the second tablets, Chassidus says, is because they correspond to the service of teshuvah. The Torah was given so that this low world could be elevated and made into a dwelling place for G-d -- which is the service of teshuvah. This is achieved through man's work (in addition to the Torah given from G-d), for through toil in Torah, a Jew reaches the loftiest levels. And this is the distinction of the second tablets -- "Halachos, Midrash and Aggadah ... double strength." It includes all aspects of the Torah: not just the general rules given to Moshe at Sinai, but everything that will be deduced in all generations through Jews' toil in the Torah.
