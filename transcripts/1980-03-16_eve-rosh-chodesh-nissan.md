## Significance of Rosh Chodesh Nissan

The address emphasizes that this date marks when the Mishkan (sanctuary) was erected. According to the teaching, "everything constructed by Moshe is eternal" and will be revealed again in Messianic times.

## Connection to Pesach Preparation

The Rebbe discusses how two weeks before Passover, people should begin studying relevant laws and customs. He specifically mentions Maos Chittim (charitable funds for the poor during Pesach).

## Innovative Campaign for Children

A central theme involves engaging Jewish children in Pesach preparations through contests and prizes. The approach aims to have children take leadership roles in selling chametz, searching for leavened products, and enriching Seder celebrations.

## Integration of Service

The discourse explains balancing two types of service: "good to Heaven" and "good to the creatures," demonstrating how these should be unified rather than separated.

## Expected Outcomes

The Rebbe anticipates that child-led initiatives will inspire entire families toward greater Torah observance, comparing this to successful Shabbos candle-lighting campaigns.
