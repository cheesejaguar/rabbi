## 1. Roots in the Torah

The Sages teach that "There is nothing that is not alluded to in the Torah." It is clear, then, that there must be a hint in the Torah to the message of Lag BaOmer.

Two such allusions are cited in the literature of Chassidus. The first appears in the verse, "And Lavan said, 'This mound (gal) is a witness (ed) between me and you this day.' It was therefore called Gal'ed." The second appears in the verse, "Uncover (gal) my eyes, so that I may behold wondrous things from Your Torah." In each case, the letters gal spell Lag (BaOmer).

## 2. Sparks Shackled in Exile

The former phrase was spoken when Lavan, having pursued Yaakov, caught up to him. As conceived from the perspective of our classical sources, Lavan's pursuit of Yaakov was not motivated simply by a desire to do him harm. Rather, the true and underlying reason was that when Yaakov had concluded his spiritual labors of refining the materiality of Charan, certain holy sparks still remained in Lavan's hands.

This situation has a parallel in our times -- the era of ikvesa diMeshicha, the generation that can hear the approaching footsteps of Mashiach. In our times, after all the labors of seeking and uplifting sparks throughout all the exiles, there is still work to be done with the very last sparks.

## 3. Chassidus for Everyman

Since we are now at the conclusion of this state of exile and are elevating the very last sparks, it is obvious how great is the need to unlock and disseminate the pnimiyus of the Torah.

The Baal Shem Tov and the Maggid labored to demonstrate that the innermost, mystical dimension of the Torah is relevant to all Jews. The Alter Rebbe labored to demonstrate that its understanding is accessible to all Jews. As to the Rebbe Rayatz, he labored to demonstrate that even people of modest intellect are able to grasp chassidic teachings. For this reason, in recent years he published maamarim in Yiddish.

Since in our days we have to complete the liberation of the very last sparks and to bring about the coming of our righteous Mashiach, we have to escalate the revelation and dissemination of the teachings of Chassidus -- for it is through this activity that "the master will come, namely, the King Mashiach."

## 4. A Safe Distance

A person is obliged to engage in the things of this world in order to refine and elevate his body, his animal soul, and his allotted share of this world. At the very time he does this, however, he should maintain a certain separateness from the world's physicality. He should realize that apart from his task of beirurim he has no other connection with worldly things.

Above all else, it is by studying the pnimiyus of the Torah that one is empowered to create this separating "mound", for through this study one becomes aware that "there is nothing else other than Him."

## 5. Superrational Demarcation

A mound is made up of stones. In terms of avodah, stones serve as a classical metaphor for the letters that combine to constitute the words of the Holy Tongue. Rather than representing reason, stones primarily represent the unbending and unquestioning acceptance of the yoke of heaven known as kabbalas ol.

The theme of Lag BaOmer is related to the Sefirah of Hod -- indeed, to the ultimate expression of that Sefirah, which is called Hod shebeHod. Avodah in the spirit of this Sefirah is not guided by mortal reason, but by hodaah, the unquestioning acknowledgment and acceptance of the Divine Will.

## 6. Reaching Upward

In a sichah delivered on Lag BaOmer, 5701 [1941], the Rebbe Rayatz states that Lag BaOmer is related to the Sefirah of Tiferes -- indeed, to the ultimate expression of that Sefirah, which is called Tiferes shebeTiferes.

The downward direction represents divine service prompted by mortal understanding. The upward direction represents divine service prompted by kabbalas ol alone. It is only when one's avodah is characterized by unquestioning acknowledgment (hodaah) stemming from kabbalas ol (Hod shebeHod), that one can arrive at the ultimate heights of beauty (Tiferes shebeTiferes).

## 7. Exert One Little Finger

In keeping with the Talmudic assumption that "whoever gives a gift gives generously," whatever insights and powers that the Rebbe grants us are the ultimate in beauty. However, in order to receive the Rebbe's gifts, one must first dedicate oneself to him with kabbalas ol.

A classic instance: When R. Chanina ben Dosa asked the angels to take a huge stone for him to Jerusalem, they agreed -- "provided that you join your hand and finger to our effort." This he did, "and they found themselves standing in Jerusalem."

## 8. From the Palace to the Fields

On Lag BaOmer, the Mitteler Rebbe used to go out into the fields. At this time people saw many miracles, for the blessings he then gave enabled barren women to bear sons who grew up to be fine chassidim.

When a king is out in the field, "whoever wishes to do so may approach him and greet him, and he receives them all with a friendly countenance." When he is in his royal palace, "one may enter only when permitted."

Going out into the fields on Lag BaOmer signifies stepping down to the lowest level within the realm of holiness, to a level that calls for the "mound" (gal) comprised in Lag BaOmer.

## 9. Selfless Risk

This theme recalls the arrival in America of the Rebbe Rayatz. The Rebbe Rayatz's arrival in America may be perceived as "going out into the fields for the sake of bringing into the world male children who would grow up to be chassidim":

- *"Going out into the fields":* a descent out into the realities of the "lower hemisphere."
- *"For the sake of bringing into the world male children":* sons who will conquer the world.
- *"Who would grow up to be chassidim":* workers who do not seek to be rewarded by spiritual bliss. People of this caliber act with self-sacrifice.

## 10. Dare to Dive

True enough, it is difficult to go out to some town in order to conquer it. How can one go to a town where there won't even be anyone with whom he can talk about the Rebbe? Nevertheless, since this is the mission entrusted by the Rebbe, one has to put himself aside and carry out his task.

The Rebbe did not seek out easy tasks for himself, neither did he seek out easy tasks for us. He himself confronted all challenges with self-sacrifice, and from us likewise he demands self-sacrifice.

## 11. Let the Navigator Provide the Compass

When a person goes about his divine service under his own steam, he cannot be certain that he will succeed in arriving at the truth. When, however, he engages in the mission entrusted to him by the Rebbe, he will certainly arrive at the truth, because at such a time he is impelled not by his own power, but by the power of the Rebbe.

## 12. Descent for the Sake of Ascent

The Gemara spells out Chanah's prayer: "Sovereign of the Universe! If You will look, well and good, but if You will not look, I will go and seclude myself... Since I will have been alone, they will make me drink the waters of the suspected wife. And You cannot make a travesty of Your Torah, which states, 'She shall be cleared and shall conceive seed...'"

Along these lines we learn that R. Zeira undertook one hundred fasts in order to forget the Babylonian Talmud, so that he would then be able to study the Jerusalem Talmud. This is the inner meaning of the verse, "A tzaddik may fall seven times, and yet rises again."

## 13. Irreplaceable Moments

A gap in the Counting of the Omer cannot be replenished. The same principle applies with the ongoing mitzvah to study Torah -- time lost cannot be compensated.

The same applies to the mission entrusted to us by the Rebbe. Fulfilling this mission is an obligation that devolves upon every chassid at all times. If one day's obligation is not discharged, it cannot be compensated for on another day.

## 14. By the Power of the Rebbe

One should not indulge in private calculations, but simply devote oneself completely to the Rebbe. And then, everything is accomplished by the power of the Rebbe.

## 15. Spirit Over Matter

The Rebbe Rashab once said: "Why are you so downcast? There is a verse that says, 'When the chayos were raised up..., the ofanim were raised up.' That is to say: With the ascent of the chayos (ruchniyus, one's spiritual dimension), as a matter of course the ofanim (gashmiyus, one's material dimension) will be raised up."

## 16. The Rebbe in Your Mind's Eye

The Rebbe Rayatz describes how during imprisonment, thoughts about his family darkened his spirits. His solution: "My mind lit up as with a lightning flash: Enough of those thoughts!... At that moment I ascended to heavenly heights with lofty thoughts..."

Later: "The place and the time demand the courageous heart and high spirits that spring from meditation upon a mental picture of the holy face of my revered father, [the Rebbe Rashab]."

From time to time, in his mind's eye, every individual should picture the Rebbe's holy face and recall teachings that he heard from his lips.

## 17. The Anniversary of Rashbi

Another step is to visit the resting place of the Rebbe and to pray there, for wherever the lowest element of a man is to be found, at that place a bond is set up with the yechidah, the innermost aspect of the soul.

The Rebbe suggested that on Lag BaOmer, the festive anniversary of the passing of Rashbi, the whole community should go out to visit the Ohel, where Rashbi, too, is present.
