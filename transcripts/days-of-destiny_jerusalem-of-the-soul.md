# Jerusalem of the Soul

**Occasion:** 10th of Teves
**Source:** Days of Destiny, Sichos In English

---

The tenth day of Teves commemorates when "the wicked Nevuchadnetzar, king of Babylon, surrounded Jerusalem and laid siege to it." This fast day carries special significance in Jewish tradition as a day intended for spiritual improvement and repentance.

## The Purpose of Fasting

A properly observed fast is "a day desirable to G-d." The prophet Yeshayahu emphasizes that true fasting involves more than self-affliction — it requires sharing bread with the hungry, bringing the poor into one's home, and clothing the naked. Therefore, fasting emphasizes three pillars: Torah study, prayer, and good deeds.

The fast's ultimate purpose is repentance and improvement in serving G-d. According to Rambam, public fasts like the tenth of Teves exist "to inspire the heart to open to the ways of repentance," serving as reminders of past misdeeds that caused calamities.

## The Siege as Warning

The tenth of Teves receives unusual stringency because the siege was not merely an isolated tragedy but the root cause of subsequent disasters — the breaching of Jerusalem's walls on the seventeenth of Tammuz and the destruction of the Temple on the ninth of Av. The siege functioned as a divine warning to prompt repentance before greater catastrophes occurred.

## Jerusalem and Babylon: Spiritual Symbolism

The text employs rich symbolism: Jerusalem (Yerushalayim) derives from words meaning "fear" and "complete," representing perfect fear of heaven. Within every Jew exists this inner Jerusalem — a spiritual fortress where faith remains absolute and distinctions between sacred and profane are crystal clear.

Babylon (Bavel) relates to confusion and mixture. It represents the mundane world where sacred, profane, and forbidden elements intertwine confusingly. The "king of Babylon" symbolizes the evil inclination.

## The Danger of Proximity

When the evil inclination attempts rapprochement between Jerusalem and Babylon, it doesn't directly seduce toward obvious evil. Instead, it seeks mere proximity — a siege that weakens absolute devotion. This proximity itself constitutes the greatest danger.

The text warns against overlooking minor rabbinic enactments or treating seemingly unimportant laws lightly. Such compromises weaken "perfect fear of heaven" and invite escalating transgressions. The Talmud notes that the evil inclination gradually convinces people: today suggesting one action, tomorrow another, until ultimately leading them toward idolatry.

## The Positive Potential of the Siege

Remarkably, the prophet Yechezkel describes the siege using the Hebrew word somach — which typically means "support." This linguistic choice reflects that the siege, despite being undesirable, originated from holiness and was intended beneficially. G-d sent the siege as a merciful warning, offering opportunity for repentance that could have transformed potential tragedy into victory.

Historical precedent supports this: when Sancheriv earlier besieged Jerusalem, King Chizkiyahu's prayers inspired divine intervention that routed the entire Assyrian army in a single night.

## Spiritual Application Today

The lesson applies to each person's inner Jerusalem. When spiritual complacency causes one's fear of G-d to lie dormant, a siege — representing life's difficulties — can arouse dormant spiritual powers and revitalize commitment to Torah and mitzvos.

Furthermore, a Jew need not merely survive the siege defensively. Through proper conduct, one can advance offensively, elevating mundane worldly matters toward holiness. By sanctifying daily activities and recognizing that worldly success derives solely from G-d's blessing, a person elevates Babylon itself to Jerusalem's spiritual level.

The ultimate vision expressed by the Sages is that "Jerusalem will encompass all of Eretz Yisroel, and Eretz Yisroel will encompass all the lands" — all creation elevated to sanctity.
