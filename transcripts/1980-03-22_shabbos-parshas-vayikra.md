## Section 1: Children and Pesach

The discourse begins with discussion of preparations for Pesach and the relationship between parents and children. The text emphasizes that "children must show proper respect to parents" but parents must earn this respect through proper education with enthusiasm.

The teaching draws a parallel to the relationship between G-d and the Jewish people, noting how "the Jewish people through their service awaken new and higher spiritual forces." The text connects this concept to Purim, explaining how the miracle occurred when "the sleep of the King was disturbed" -- the King referring to G-d.

A key emphasis involves the Purim narrative: "the decree was negated not because of the efforts of Mordechai, but because of the childrens' studies." The text describes how Mordechai gathered children to study Torah, and their collective study became the instrument for nullifying Haman's decree.

The teaching notes that Parshas Vayikra contains a small Aleph (first letter), symbolizing small children. This letter represents "Chief of the worlds," connecting to the principle that every Jew should recognize "the world was created for me."

## Section 2: Children's Torah Education

This section discusses the educational tradition of introducing children to Torah study through Parshas Vayikra. A story is recounted about the Alter Rebbe bringing his grandson, the Tzemach Tzedek, to study this portion.

The child asked his grandfather: "Why does the word Vayikra have a small Alef?" This question prompted the Alter Rebbe into deep meditation and led to the revelation of profound Torah concepts -- demonstrating how children's questions can elevate parental understanding.

The text addresses an apparent contradiction: Rashi suggests beginning Torah study with either Bereishis or HaChodesh, yet tradition teaches beginning with Vayikra. The explanation provided distinguishes between different spiritual approaches:

- Bereishis involves "meditation on the natural order of creation"
- HaChodesh involves "meditation on miracles"
- Each possesses unique advantages depending on spiritual context

The teaching explains two levels of Teshuvah (repentance):

1. Teshuvah for sins -- escaping evil
2. Higher Teshuvah -- connecting to G-d's essence where "the spirit returns to G-d, who gave it"

A child's nature is described as essentially pure because children "do not know the taste of sin." This purity is not achieved through effort but is inherent to their state. Therefore, children should study Vayikra, which deals with sacrifices in their pure form -- as they existed before the Torah's detailed commandments.

The practical lesson concludes: Parents should encourage children to ask "why was I created as a child?" This prompts parents to explain that children possess inherent purity absent in adults, allowing their spiritual service to reach higher levels. This understanding should inspire children to ask the Four Questions with greater depth during the Seder, motivating adults toward more meaningful observance and bringing them to proclaim "Next year in Yerushalayim," thereby hastening redemption.

## Footnotes

**Note 121:** The relationship between Torah and Teshuvah parallels parent-child dynamics -- Teshuvah is higher than Torah, yet Torah reveals this truth. Similarly, children are higher than parents, yet parents must educate properly for this quality to manifest.

**Note 122:** The Jewish soul's descent into the body mirrors revelation from above to below. Despite the darkness of exile, through spiritual service within physical reality, the soul achieves elevated heights.

**Note 123:** The Purim miracle's aftermath included "many of the peoples of the land converted to Judaism," connected to the mitzvah of Tzedakah. The text extends this concept beyond literal conversion to include elevating "sparks of G-dliness" through material service.

**Note 124:** The number 24,000 carries significance. In the Midyan war, 12,000 soldiers were sent (1,000 per tribe). Purim's connection to Teshuvah required double this number, as the Alter Rebbe teaches in Tanya that one performing repentance should "study two pages" instead of one.

**Note 125:** The emphasis on children and "spreading the wellsprings of Chassidus outward" reflects a historical pattern -- the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Chassidus, initially worked as a children's teacher before revealing Chassidus to adults.

**Note 126:** Different Torah portions correspond to different times of the year. When Bereishis is read, its particular spiritual influences become prominent. When HaChodesh is read, its unique qualities come to the fore.

**Note 127:** An explanatory note raises the question of how children differ from gentiles, since both exist outside Torah's direct governance. The answer: children will eventually become obligated in Torah and mitzvos, revealing their essential connection to purity -- an inherent quality that cannot be affected by sin.

**Note 128:** The Rebbe Rashab declared that reflecting daily on children's education is obligatory for every Jew, comparable to wearing Tefillin.
