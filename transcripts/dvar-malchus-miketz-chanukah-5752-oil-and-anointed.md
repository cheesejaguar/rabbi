This sicha discusses Chanukah through the lens of Jewish mystical teachings, examining oil as a symbol for inner Torah dimensions.

## Oil's Symbolism

"Bread and water are a perquisite for life" corresponding to revealed Torah, while wine represents luxury mirroring Torah's secrets. Oil, consumed sparingly and only when added to other substances, symbolizes "the 'secrets of the secrets' of the Torah."

## Historical Revelation

The Rebbe traces progressive revelations of inner Torah knowledge through Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and the Zohar, the Arizal's teachings, the Baal Shem Tov's Chassidus, and specifically Chabad teachings. These developments connect to Moshiach, as "Moshiach" means "anointed" with oil.

## Contemporary Relevance

"As the darkness of exile increases, there is a greater need for a greater amount of oil (meaning an increase in the learning of Pnimiyus Hatorah)."

## Connection to Moshiach

Approaching Moshiach's arrival intensifies both divine revelation and opposing forces. The "soldiers of the house of Dovid" combat those resisting redemption through disseminating this inner Torah knowledge.

## Final Message

Believers should strengthen faith in Moshiach's imminent arrival and increase study and teaching of Torah's inner dimensions.
