This chapter examines the transition from the festival-rich month of Tishrei to the everyday service required throughout the rest of the year.

## The Spiritual Shift

Tishrei's many festivals (Rosh HaShanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkos, Shemini Atzeres, Simchas Torah) provide "spiritual nourishment" that sustains a Jew's service during ordinary weekdays. After these holidays, the announcement of "Yaakov went on his way" marks when regular service begins.

## Everyday Holiness

According to the teaching, a Jew's mundane activities — business, personal affairs, work — must all be dedicated to serving the Creator. As stated: "all your deeds should be for the sake of heaven" and "in all your ways you shall know Him." The goal is transforming the physical world into a dwelling place for the Divine.

## Three Names of Service

The text analyzes "Yaakov went on his way" through wordplay:
- *Yaakov* (lowest level) represents handling worldly matters
- *Went* emphasizes continuous spiritual elevation
- *His way* connects mundane work to G-d's purpose

## Unity in Diversity

Despite individual Jews pursuing different paths in their service, they remain one people. This unity persists even when dispersing into personal affairs after the communal festival season.
