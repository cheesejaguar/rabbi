# Vayechi 5752: Using Iron for Holiness

## Opening Theme

The parsha begins with "Vayechi Yaakov" ("Yaakov lived"). Though the parsha describes Yaakov's death, the sages teach that "Yaakov Avinu didn't die -- just as his children are alive, so too he is alive."

## The Rebbe's Explanation

"The life of Yaakov is eternal life through this that it is drawn to his children and their descendants until the end of all generations. His children are alive meaning true life through learning and fulfilling the Torah. The name of the parsha is named after the life of Yaakov since the truth of the life of Yaakov, eternal life, is expressed in the life of his children."

## Iron and Holiness Concept

The parsha connects to the Fast of the Tenth of Teves, when Jerusalem's walls were besieged. In Yechezkiel's prophecy about destruction, iron symbolized siege. The Midrash states: "This is the gift...gold, silver, and copper...but iron is not written here, neither by the Mishkan nor by the Mikdash. Why? Because Edom is likened to it, and they are the ones who destroyed the Beis Hamikdash."

## Positive Iron -- "Barzel D'Kedusha"

The Rebbe introduces "iron of holiness," referring to spiritual strength and fortitude for Torah and Mitzvos. This means "stiff-necked" in a positive sense -- the essence of the soul's strength.

The third Beis Hamikdash will be built with iron because the opposite holiness's destructive iron will be nullified and refined. The siege wasn't merely destruction but the beginning of redemption, like sowing seeds that precedes sprouting.

## Parshas Vayechi as Shabbos Chazak

This final parsha of Genesis includes "Chazak Chazak V'nischazek" ("Be strong, be strong, and may we be strengthened!"). The strengthening throughout exile is "Vayechi Yaakov" -- Yaakov lives. His eternal life is revealed through Torah and the sages' teaching that he did not die.

## Transformation Through Strength

The task is to stand with "strength and fortitude of iron for matters of holiness," transforming the destructive iron into holy iron that builds the future Beis Hamikdash through Moshiach.

## Eternal Life Promise

Yaakov merited to experience the eternal life of the world to come during his earthly life. In the future, all Jews will experience this with their children and ancestors in the resurrection.

The Rebbe concludes: "All of Bnei Yisroel in our generation...living souls in living bodies without any interruption...will be alive, living eternally in the simple sense, beginning with the Bnei Yisroel of our generation, souls in bodies, for long and good years...eternal life."

Even the resolution to increase in one mitzvah acts as sowing that brings the "sprouting" of Redemption. Connection to the Nosi (Leader) of the generation, who "did not die" like Yaakov, draws this eternal life into each person.
