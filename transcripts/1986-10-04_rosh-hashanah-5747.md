## Part 1

The discourse begins by recounting a custom of the Rebbe Rashab to share Torah thoughts connected to the Rebbes of Chabad on the second day of Rosh Hashanah, honoring figures including the Baal Shem Tov, the Great Maggid, and others in the lineage.

The text emphasizes the Alter Rebbe's teaching that Jews should "live with the times," drawing spiritual instruction from weekly Torah portions and daily study sections.

### Connecting Ha'azinu to Rosh Hashanah

The discourse references Deuteronomy 32:3: "For it is the Name of G-d that I proclaim, ascribe greatness to our G-d," illustrating how Jewish Divine service creates "greatness" and fulfills God's desire for human action.

A Midrash is cited: "You would have a desire to the work of Your hands" (Job 14:15), suggesting God desires human fulfillment of His will.

The text explains that Elul's preparation uses the acrostic "I am devoted to my Beloved, and my Beloved is devoted to me," establishing that humans initiate service, prompting divine response.

### Rosh Hashanah's Cosmic Significance

According to Chassidic teaching presented here, "the renewal of all creation on Rosh Hashanah each year depends on, and is effected by, the Divine service of the Jewish people."

The discourse cites the Alter Rebbe's explanation of shofar-blowing, describing how it awakens and draws "new radiance, from the highest source and root, of the inner reaches of supernal delight, close to the essential essence."

The Baal Shem Tov's question is presented: The Torah says "Blow at the New Moon the shofar," emphasizing that the blowing must be "new" and not a hackneyed statute.

### Innovation in Divine Service

Each year's shofar service must be performed anew so that "the radiation of G-dly life-force into all the worlds will likewise be new on Rosh Hashanah."

The discourse notes that these are "intensely esoteric and intrinsic levels," where changes occur internally despite external appearances remaining unchanged.

### Praise and Importance

The Tzemach Tzedek and Rebbe Maharash are cited discussing Deuteronomy 26:17: "Today you have granted praise and importance to G-d," where "today" refers to Rosh Hashanah.

A Talmudic passage (Berachos 6a) is quoted: "The Holy One, Blessed be He, sings the praises of Israel...it is written 'today you have granted praises and importance to G-d....' The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Israel: 'You have made Me a unique entity in the world...,' as it is written: 'Hear O Israel, the L-rd is our G-d, the L-rd is One.'"

The discourse emphasizes that this demonstrates Jews "effect a state of praise Above, which is tangible and appreciable."

### The Ultimate Purpose of Creation

The text references the Rebbe Rashab's discourse "The Holiday of Rosh Hashanah" from 5666, explaining spiritual revelations on Rosh Hashanah parallel future ultimate revelations.

The purpose of creation is described as God's desire for "a dwelling place in the lower worlds," specifically "this material world of Asiyah (action)."

The discourse states: "all the supernal worlds wait for, anticipate and need a Jew's Divine Service in this physical world, to raise them and enhance their existence."

### Connection to Moshiach

The ultimate realization occurs only in Messianic times, when Isaiah 40:5 will be fulfilled: "The glory of G-d will be revealed and all flesh will see...."

Isaiah 30:20 is cited: "Yet your teacher shall not withdraw him self any more...your eyes shall see your teacher."

The discourse explains that Mattan Torah (the giving of Torah at Sinai) temporarily revealed G-dliness, which will become permanent with Moshiach's arrival.

### Rosh Hashanah and Shabbos Connection

When Rosh Hashanah falls on Shabbos, the discourse notes qualities are enhanced, with the holiday's theme expressing itself through Shabbos's theme.

The three aspects of Rosh Hashanah -- kingship, remembrance, and the shofar -- correspond to three aspects of Divine light and three Shabbos meals:

- First meal: G-dly life-force filling the world
- Second meal: transcending light
- Third meal: essential Ein Sof, similar to the world to come

The discourse states: "the connection of Rosh Hashanah with the future redemption is more strongly accentuated when Rosh Hashanah occurs on Shabbos."

### Blessings and Petitions

The text requests: "a Kesivo vaChasimo Tovo, for a good and sweet year -- to be inscribed in the book of the completely righteous."

It emphasizes that on Rosh Hashanah, people are judged regarding "corporeal matters, children, health, and abundant sustenance."

The discourse notes: "During Elul when the king was available, everyone could approach the king. Now, on Rosh Hashanah the revelation from the essence is even more intense."

### The Exile and Redemption

The text discusses fulfilling creation's purpose "to make the world a dwelling place for G-d," which will occur "at the close of this diaspora period when we will enjoy the light of G-dliness in the darkness of the golus."

An Egyptian parallel is drawn: "just as the Jews had light in the days of darkness while still in Egypt. The light even illuminated the lowly houses of the Egyptians."

Exodus 12:36 is referenced: "The Israelites thus drained Egypt of its wealth."

The discourse explains that in the current exile, "sparks" of holiness have been refined, and "all that remains for us to do is to 'polish the buttons,' as the Previous Rebbe expressed it; only a bit of polish and shine is lacking."

### Requirements for Redemption

Three completeness requirements are outlined:

1. **Complete Torah:** The verse "until they were completed" (Deuteronomy 31:30) indicates Torah is complete only when Jews study and develop principles to halachic conclusions.

2. **Complete People:** The Midrash is cited stating that even ministering angels defer to Jewish courts regarding the new year.

3. **Complete Land:** Deuteronomy 11:12 states "A land...the eyes of G-d your L-rd are on it at all times, from the beginning of the year until the end of the year."

The text indicates "beginning" and "end" refer to Rosh Hashanah, and the land must be expanded from the seven nations to include the ten nations, eventually encompassing all lands when "G-dliness will truly be revealed."

### Conclusion of Part 1

The discourse connects the Torah portion Ha'azinu to V'Zos Haberachah, whose theme is "the radiation of blessings to all the Jewish people in a revealed and good way. So that we may point and say, 'This is the blessing.'"

The text notes that Berachah connects to Rosh Hashanah: "He (G-d) was King in Yeshurun," where coronation occurs when Jews accept Divine kingship on Rosh Hashanah.

The section closes with the blessing: "a blessing for Kesivo vaChasimo Tovo, a sweet and good year and the true redemption, through our righteous Moshiach, truly and speedily in our time."

## Part 2

The second section examines the daily Rambam study section, finding connections to Rosh Hashanah themes.

### Laws of Tumas Tzora'as (Plague-spots)

At the conclusion of this section, the Rambam discusses avoiding evil speech, stating: "But the conversation of the worthy ones in Israel is none other than words of Torah and wisdom...."

The discourse notes that speech represents "the sphere of Malchus -- kingship," which is built on Rosh Hashanah.

The symbolic reference to kingship is found in chapter 16, halachah 10, since "kingship, which is the tenth attribute."

### Malachi and Remembrance

The Rambam quotes Malachi 3:16: "And they that feared the L-rd spoke together every man to his neighbor, and the L-rd hearkened and heard. And a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the L-rd and that thought upon His Name."

The discourse identifies three Rosh Hashanah themes:

**A. Fear of G-d:**
"When the Rambam speaks of 'they that feared the L-rd...,' he is referring to one of the themes of Rosh Hashanah -- for the coronation of a king is connected with yirah -- fear."

The Gemara (Sanhedrin 22a) is cited explaining that crowning a king involves accepting the awe of his rule.

The use of plural form ("they") references Rosh Hashanah because "the crowning of the king may take place only when the masses are ready to accept the yoke of his rule. The great multitude gives glory to the king."

**B. Book of Remembrance:**
"'And a book of remembrance was written,' clearly a reference to Rosh Hashanah -- the day of remembrance."

**C. Thought Upon His Name:**
The word "choshvei" (thought upon) can imply "chashivus" (importance), connecting to the Chumash verse "ascribe greatness to our G-d."

The discourse explains: "Those who fear G-d increase the honor and importance given to G-d," fulfilling this purpose through Divine service.

### Rosh Hashanah and Creation of Man

The text states: "Rosh Hashanah is the anniversary of the creation of Man, at which time all of creation was raised to the state of being 'very good,' because through his Divine service man makes the world a dwelling place for G-dliness."

The Rambam's discussion of Tumah (impurity) concludes by directing toward converting "Tumah to Taharah" and making "the person's life worthwhile and holy by converting the idle or evil talk to talk of Torah and mitzvos."

### Rosh Hashanah on Shabbos

When Rosh Hashanah falls on Shabbos, the theme of rectifying the mundane and making it holy is emphasized more strongly, similar to repentance.

A Midrash is cited: when Shabbos begins and we recite "A psalm, a song for the Shabbos day" (Psalms 92:1), "we are referring to the state of repentance which Adam reached with the advent of the first Shabbos."

The Alter Rebbe's Tanya is referenced, stating that "Shabbos" shares root letters with the word for "return," connecting them thematically.

The Rambam hints at the Shabbos theme when mentioning those who "thought" upon G-d's Name, since "Shabbos is considered the realm of 'thought' as compared to the rest of the week."

### Levels of Fear

The discourse explains that the Rambam's emphasis on evil speech is to prevent underestimating its harm, while positive speech in Torah and mitzvos elevates a person progressively.

Starting with "the basic level of fear of G-d, which is the first rung in Divine service," progression occurs toward "a higher fear based on self-awareness and shame that comes from intellectual evaluation and analysis."

These levels lead to love of G-d, which follows as a gift, and all fear levels interconnect to include "the ultimate expression of fear which will evolve at the time of Moshiach."

Isaiah 2:21 is cited: "To go into the clefts of the rocks...for fear of the L-rd."

### Final Vision

The discourse concludes that at Moshiach's time, "we will reach the perfection of a complete people, with the complete Torah, in the complete land. All united in the true dwelling place for the Shechinah in the material world, with joy and gladness."
