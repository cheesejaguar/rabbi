# Hoshana Rabbah, 5743

**Date:** October 8, 1982 (21st Tishrei 5743)
**Occasion:** Hoshana Rabbah
**Source:** Sichos In English, Volume 15

1. The 7th night of Simchas Bais Hashoevah exceeds previous nights because of the principle to "rise in holiness," and as the concluding night, it encompasses all others. "Everything follows the conclusion," making tonight's joy greater than any other night.

There are multiple levels within "wellsprings of salvation" and correspondingly multiple levels of water drawn from them. The 7th day of drawing represents a higher level than preceding days. The concept of conclusion relates to sealing -- ensuring the elevated drawing remains uncompromised.

Tonight combines being the 7th night of Simchas Bais Hashoevah with Hoshana Rabbah status, adding multiple service elements: recital of "tikkun" including Sefer Devorim, Tehillim, "Yehi Rotzon," and selections from Zohar.

2. Hoshana Rabbah's guests are King Dovid and Rebbe Rashab. The Rambam links King David to Simchas Bais Hashoevah through his conduct of rejoicing before the Lord. "The joy that a person has in performing a mitzvah ... is a great service." David exemplified this through dancing and leaping before the Lord.

The practice of reciting Tehillim (David's psalms) includes the "Yehi Rotzon" prayer: "May the recital of these psalms of Tehillim be counted for us as if Dovid King of Israel himself said them." Since King David is Hoshana Rabbah's guest, practitioners more easily achieve this identification.

Rebbe Rashab founded Yeshivas Tomchei Tmimim to establish "soldiers of the house of Dovid" for "the wars of the house of Dovid" -- to illuminate the world and maintain faith in Moshiach's coming during the "footsteps of Moshiach."

3. The day's Chumash portion connects to the wars of David's house. The verse about a dwelling place for the eternal G-d and Rashi's explanation indicate that beneath G-d's dwelling, "all men of might dwell," causing them to fear and tremble before Him. This knowledge enables Jews to engage in "the wars of the house of Dovid" with trust in G-d's might, assuring success.

"Yisroel dwells safely alone just like Ya'akov," remaining unaffected by worldly nations. Adversaries are abolished -- "He drove out the enemy from before you, and said 'destroy'" -- and "non-Jewish peoples will change their attitude towards you," transitioning from enemies to helpers.
