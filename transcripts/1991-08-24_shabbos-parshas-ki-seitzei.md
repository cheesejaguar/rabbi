There is always a connection between the Torah portion read Shabbos morning and the portion read Shabbos afternoon. Nevertheless, the two portions read this week, Ki Seitzei and Ki Savo appear to be opposite in nature. As the very name implies, Ki Seitzei speaks of going out, while Ki Savo speaks of coming in. More particularly, Ki Seitzei refers to going out to war, while Ki Savo speaks of entering Eretz Yisrael, settling the land, and bringing the offering of the first fruits to the Beis HaMikdash.

In a spiritual sense, Parshas Ki Seitzei refers to the soul's descent from the spiritual worlds into the confines and limits of the body, the animal soul, and our material world. And in this sphere, the soul must carry out its service of refinement, confronting the above elements and in a manner figuratively associated with war, elevating their spiritual content. This is particularly true in the era of exile when G-dliness is concealed and carrying out the service mentioned above involves a greater conflict.

In contrast, Parshas Ki Savo refers to service carried out amid peace of mind, serenity, and security. It refers to an era when the Jews live in Eretz Yisrael and the Beis HaMikdash is standing -- the direct opposite of the situation described in Parshas Ki Seitzei.

Furthermore, in an ultimate sense, the "coming into the land" described in Parshas Ki Savo is a reference to the settlement of Eretz Yisrael in the Era of the Redemption. Thus Parshas Ki Seitzei refers to the service which the Jews must carry out in the present era, while Parshas Ki Savo refers to the ultimate reward to be received for that service in the Era of the Redemption.

The seeming difficulty raised by this contrast can be resolved as follows: The service involving war and conflict must be carried out with peace of mind. And this is possible by experiencing a foretaste of the ultimate reward to be experienced in the Era of the Redemption at present.

This idea can be explained within the context of a verse from this week's Torah reading. In regard to a hired worker, we are commanded, "Give him his wage on that day." The Jews can be compared to workers hired by G-d to carry out the task of refining the world. Thus, in addition to the ultimate reward which the Jews will receive in the Era of the Redemption, as a fulfillment of the above-mentioned command, they must be given a full reward at present -- a foretaste of the ultimate reward -- for the service which they carry out.

Rashi states that Parshas Ki Seitzei describes a "voluntary war," i.e., a war which the Jews are not commanded to wage, but wage because of the decision of the king and the Sanhedrin. This raises a question: Seemingly, the service of confronting the challenge posed by the body and one's surrounding environment is an obligation and not something desired by the Jews. Why is such a comparison made in reference to voluntary wars?

These difficulties can be resolved by focusing on the meaning of the word Seitzei, "go out." A Jew's service in the world at large involves going out from his natural place. The natural place, the source, of a Jew's soul is in the world of Atzilus, a realm in which everything is one with G-d. Indeed, on a deeper level, the soul's source is on a much higher plane, for "the souls of the Jewish people preceded all entities," and they are one with G-d at a plane of existence that transcends the highest conception of spiritual being. "Israel and the Holy One, blessed be He, are all one."

On this basis, we can explain the relationship of Parshas Ki Seitzei to voluntary wars. Since the Jews are one with G-d's essence, all service within the limitations of this world involves "going out." Nevertheless, our Sages teach us that when G-d created the world, He "consulted with the souls of the righteous," i.e., every Jew, for "Your nation are all righteous." Since the Jews gave their consent for the creation of the world, their service within the world is considered voluntary in nature.

And therefore, the Jews deserve a reward for their service. Since in an ultimate sense, the Jews are not required to carry out this service, for in essence they are above the limits of this world, their willingness to involve themselves in such activities causes them to be deemed worthy of receiving a reward.

To explain this on a deeper level: The soul leaves its true state, the level of oneness with G-d, and descends to this world, because it is through this descent that it can bring about the fulfillment of G-d's desire for a dwelling in the lower worlds. And it is in this dwelling -- and through the service of transforming darkness into light -- that His essence will be revealed.

Together with this service comes its reward, "The reward for a mitzvah is a mitzvah," i.e., the mitzvah itself is its greatest reward. In Tanya, after the Alter Rebbe explains that the ultimate purpose for the creation of the world is that "the Holy One, blessed be He, desired a dwelling in the lower worlds," he continues:

The ultimate state of fulfillment that will be manifest in the Era of the Redemption and in the Era of the Resurrection, i.e., the revelation of [G-d's] Infinite Light... in this material world, is dependent on our deeds and service throughout the era of exile. For the cause of the reward for the mitzvah is the mitzvah itself, since by performing the mitzvah a person draws down the revelation of [G-d's] Infinite Light... to enclothe itself in the material substance of this world.

With this statement, the Alter Rebbe is implying that both our service and the reward for our service focus on the same activity, revealing G-dliness in the world, transforming the world into a dwelling for G-d.

In this context, we can explain the manner in which G-d fulfills the commandment, "Give him his wage on that day." Since the performance of every mitzvah draws down the revelation of G-dliness in the world, as soon as one performs the mitzvah, one receives the reward, the revelation of G-dliness, immediately. Every mitzvah represents a personal redemption.

Moreover, the redemption as a whole is also within the grasp of every Jew. For every mitzvah a Jew performs has the potential to tip his own personal balance and that of the world at large and bring about deliverance and salvation.

Ki Seitzei involves a state of war. A Jew must realize, however, that he is "above his enemies," i.e., that there is no genuine potential for opposition in this world. Therefore, "G-d, your L-rd, will give them over to your hand and you will take captives."

There are several practical directives resulting from the above concepts: Firstly, we must publicize the concept that we are at the conclusion of the era associated with Ki Seitzei, going out to war to refine this world, and approaching the era of Ki Savo, entering Eretz Yisrael in the Era of the Redemption. Therefore, our service must focus on matters that concern the Future Redemption, the study of Torah concepts concerning Mashiach, the Redemption, and the Beis HaMikdash. Furthermore, this study must be conducted amidst peace of mind and tranquility.

Similarly, our service should be permeated with joy as a foretaste of the ultimate joy to be experienced in the Era of the Redemption when "then our mouths will be filled with joy."

Also, the present days are associated with the founding of Yeshivas Tomchei Temimim on the fifteenth of Elul. Therefore, focus should be placed on the activities of the Yeshivah and the efforts of its students who serve as "candles that shine," illuminating the world with the light of Torah, both Nigleh and P'nimiyus HaTorah.

In connection with deeds of kindness, it is also worthy to mention that the holidays of the month of Tishrei are approaching. Efforts should be made to provide those who are lacking with their holiday needs thirty days before the holiday. In this manner, they will be able to approach the holiday with peace of mind.

And these resolutions will lead to a time when each Jew will enjoy the ultimate in peace of mind. And together with the entire Jewish people, we will "come into the land... take possession of it" and bring its fruits as offerings to G-d in the Era of the Redemption. May this take place in the immediate future.

## The Fulfillment of Our Human Potential

Our Sages teach, "Precious is man, for he has been created in the image of G-d." In his Guide to the Perplexed, Maimonides explains that "the image of G-d" refers to our capacity "to conceive of intellectual ideas and to be conscious of 'Him who spoke and brought the world into being.'" This, the ability to use our minds creatively and to direct our thoughts to G-d, is the pinnacle of our human potential.

Realizing this potential is dependent on peace of mind. And peace of mind comes when a person feels spiritual purpose and fulfillment, while living in an environment which affords him peace, security, and the opportunity to satisfy his material needs.

### Structuring our Society According to G-d's Plan

Creating a setting which leads to the realization of these goals should be the purpose of every society. This can be accomplished by adopting a structure based on the seven universal laws commanded to Noah and his descendants, i.e., to all humanity. For this is the blueprint which the Almighty gave Moses to allow all men to live in harmony.

Implicit in the above blueprint is tzedakah, charity. Those who have been granted success must realize that their prosperity is a gift from G-d which carries with it the responsibility to help others who are not as fortunate.

### Educating our Youth, the Key to Making these Ideals Reality

Actualizing these ideals depends on chinuch, education. Education is, of course, not merely the transfer of knowledge, but more importantly, the communication of values and character traits which parents and grandparents have learnt through their studies and life experience. And this process of communication should flow naturally. Ideally, a child listens to his parents immediately, not because of intimidation, but as a byproduct of their ongoing relationship.

### The Ultimate Good

In an ultimate sense, it is in the Era of the Redemption that the above goals will be realized, for Mashiach, the Messiah, will:

Improve the entire world, [motivating] all the nations to serve G-d together as it is written, "I will make the peoples pure of speech so that they all will call upon the Name of G-d and serve Him with one purpose."

And the singleness of purpose shared by all people will be manifest in an era of abundant good:

There will be neither famine nor war, envy nor competition, for good things will be provided in abundance and all the delights will be as freely available as dust. The occupation of the entire world will be solely to know G-d... as it is written, "For the world will be filled with the knowledge of G-d as the waters cover the ocean bed."

### Precipitating the Era of the Redemption

We do not, however, have to wait until the future. A foretaste of this is possible in our days, and even more so at present, for we are standing at the threshold of the Era of the Redemption. This is a unique year; the Hebrew letters whose numerical equivalent is associated with this year serve as an acronym for the Hebrew phrase meaning, "This will surely be a year when 'I will show you wonders.'" And we have seen wonders -- including the miraculous victory in the Persian Gulf, an event associated by the classic text, the Yalkut Shimoni, with "the year in which the Messianic king will be revealed." Similarly, we have seen an ingathering of the exiles of Israel to our Holy Land, a foreglimpse of the ultimate return to the Land in the Messianic Era. And there have been many other miracles which we have all witnessed in both the personal and global sphere.

These are, therefore, appropriate times to incorporate in our lives the heightened spiritual awareness which we will possess in the Era of the Redemption. In this way, we can add fulfillment to our present experience and precipitate the coming of that ultimate era. May this take place in the immediate future.
