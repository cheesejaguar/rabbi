**Date:** April 14, 1985 (11th Day of Nissan, 5745)
**Occasion:** 83rd Birthday of the Lubavitcher Rebbe / Siyum of Rambam's Mishneh Torah

1. The Alter Rebbe taught us the rule: "We begin with a benediction." Why? Look into the Torah, you will see that the Torah starts with the letter "beis," which is the initial letter of the word berachah -- blessing. Thus our opening salutation tonight is:

Let him who comes be blessed with the Name of the L-rd; we bless you from the House of the L-rd. (Tehillim 118:26)

In this verse the first blessing is said in the singular form and the second blessing is plural. As each Jew arrives he receives the blessing of G-d as an individual. As the individuals join together to form a community, a "kahal gadol," the blessing is increased in quantity and quality.

And as the purpose of gathering is unity: "... and they will all form a single band to carry out your will with a perfect heart" (Amidah, Rosh Hashanah), the blessing is then bestowed in plural and in a much greater measure, the "great assemblage" engenders blessings from the aspect of "G-d is great."

This relationship of the "great assemblage" to the aspect of "G-d is great" should be viewed through the perspective of Chassidic philosophy.

Generally when the concept of "great" is spoken of, it means to indicate the loftiness of G-d and His infinite distance from all creation. In essence worldly matter bears no relationship to the existence of G-d.

Of course from our perspective we fathom the greatness of G-d only through His creations -- as it says: "How great are Your works O L-rd." From creation we extrapolate the greatness of G-d. The Rambam puts it this way:

When a person contemplates His great and wondrous works and creatures and from them obtains a glimpse of His wisdom which is incomparable and infinite, all this leads one to exclaim "G-d is great."

But a deeper contemplation will reveal that this greatness is itself a diminution of the infinite, as it must deal with finite reality, which brings the realization that G-d voluntarily concealed Himself in order to allow the force of tzimtzum to make "place" for the temporal world.

The Torah tells us how the process of creation took place: "And G-d said there shall be ... and it was..."

The Ten Utterances which created the world were actually all included in the first word "Bereishis" -- "At the beginning." The initial point of creation was brought into being by one expression, one word. See now how insignificant all existence is in relation to G-d!

The Jew can rise to the level of "great" by performing mitzvos and studying Torah. This then reveals the aspect of G-d's greatness.

Thus when there is an increase in the greatness of Jews -- when a "great assemblage" gathers, this engenders a revelation of, and effulgence from, the greatness of G-d; a bestowal of blessing on all existence.

When we gather together in the Month of Redemption, after Shabbos Hagadol, within the four days preceding Pesach, and on Tuesday, which always has the double blessing of "good for heaven and good for the creations," the blessing which G-d bestows will be permeated with the physical and the spiritual benevolence.

After attaining all of the above blessings in the fullest measure possible in golus, we are still in Mitzrayim. There are limitations and straits -- and every day, all day, we hope for the true and complete redemption through our righteous Moshiach.

Our sages assure us that we were redeemed in Nissan and the future redemption will be in Nissan. So if we increase the aspect of unity to receive an increase in G-d's blessings, it will include the blessing of the true redemption. As the Rambam rules, "immediately they are redeemed."

2. There is a topic that should have been clarified a long time ago but it was thought to be self-evident. What is the reason for the farbrengen?

In the branches of Torah known as Mussar and Chassidus, the characteristic most negated is the trait of vanity, which is portrayed as being the source of all evil attributes. Is it possible that we would allow so many people to gather for a farbrengen associated with honoring a person?

In truth however, the answer is elementary. This farbrengen is not tied to an individual or a private person, rather to the total group, and its teachings; the desires, goals, and purpose of its efforts as an ongoing 200-year-old existence.

The leaders of the movement do not constitute the central point, on the contrary, the main thing for us is the health of the movement. In fact, the leaders bear the burden, as the Talmud relates: "Do you imagine that I offer you rulership? It is servitude that I offer you."

There is well-known adage about the joy and singing and dancing of Simchas Torah. Really the Torah itself is joyous and dances. However being that it needs legs, the Jew takes hold of the Torah scroll, with the silent prayer that he is really worthy, and he becomes the legs for the Torah.

So too here, there is a need for someone to endeavor, with the help of others, to carry on the golden chain of Chassidus, to effectuate all the details and to fulfill the rule that "practice is of the essence." To bring the teachings of Chassidus into reality.

In our days, being that our Nassi, the previous Rebbe, is in the "World of Truth," he requires "arms and legs" here in the physical world to be involved in spreading his teachings and bringing them into action. To be successful it must also be organized, therefore there is someone who serves as a "servant to this people," whose role is to organize these activities.

In "cheder" they used to tell the story of one of the truly great rabbinic leaders of Israel who was small of stature and very thin. Once a group of his antagonists argued, "How is it proper that a short, scrawny Jew should be the Dayan and Rav of so large and illustrious a city?" He replied: "True, short and thin am I, but the chair on which I preside is very high!"

The "theme" of the previous Rebbe -- his teachings, and activities -- are very great, it matters not that the one who sits on the chair is small; the chair of the Nassi -- the previous Rebbe -- is great!

Actually, the greatest and most important reason for today's farbrengen is that today tens, hundreds, thousands of Jews all over the world completed learning Rambam's Mishneh Torah, therefore we have gathered here to hold a siyum and to participate in a "banquet in honor of completing the Torah."

Must we elaborate on the greatness of the Rambam? It will suffice to repeat one line which serves as the epitaph at his tomb in Tiveriah -- "From Moshe to Moshe, none arose like Moshe!"

May G-d grant that this good action will speed the fulfillment of the promise with which the Rambam concludes his work: "For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of G-d, as the waters cover the sea."

3. In the section of this week's Torah portion -- Shemini -- assigned to Tuesday, we find: "Fire came forth from before G-d and consumed the burnt offering and the choice parts on the altar. When the people saw this, they raised their voices in praise and threw themselves on their faces."

What did the revelation of the Shechinah effect? That the physical sacrifices, which included animal, vegetable and mineral were transformed and sublimated from physical existence and were enveloped in the "heavenly fire." They became an "appealing fragrance," of which G-d says: "It is pleasing to Me, for I commanded and My will was done."

Now we can see a relationship with the Rambam's Mishneh Torah. For it is a work of Halachah, having gathered all the rulings of the Oral Tradition, so that all the details are clear to the small as well as the great. Its scope includes the details of Torah which influence the world, and uplift the materialism to a higher level.

Since we are speaking of the section of Chumash learned today it is appropriate to remind and encourage everyone of the daily study pattern established by the previous Rebbe: Chumash, Tehillim and Tanya, which brings us also to the mivtzoyim: Ahavas Yisroel, Jewish Unity, Jewish self-education and education of others, Mivtza Torah, Tefillin, Mezuzah, tzedakah, Jewish books, candle lighting, kashrus, family purity, and the inscription of a letter in the Sefer Torah.

4. On the 11th day of Nissan the portion of the Nassi which is read is the Nassi of the tribe of Asher. The Midrash relates: Asher was given his name in allusion to Israel's redemption. The name Asher thus includes the meaning of happy and pleasurable.

Which connects this day of Asher with the completion of the Rambam, where he writes: "In that era ... all pleasures will be abundant like the sand of the earth." Now if all the luxuries of the world will be abundant, they will lose their value. The pleasure of that era will be in knowing G-d. As Dovid Hamelech said: "To behold the pleasantness of the L-rd."

The Rambam says that everyone's preoccupation will be to know G-d. By using the term esek he means to indicate that there will be a steady profit and increase, to the point of "dveikus." The Alter Rebbe once paraphrased the verse in Tehillim: "For whom shall I have in Heaven one day, and beside You I have no other desire on earth." On this the Alter Rebbe said: "That which is beside You I don't want, I want not physical pleasures, I want not spiritual pleasures, I want not the lower Gan Eden or the higher Gan Eden, not the world to come; I want not anything which is only beside You, I want You alone."

May it be the will of Heaven that by speaking of Torah study and observance of mitzvos, especially teshuvah, we will merit very soon to fulfill the command of the sacrifices and effect the supernal satisfaction. Being that the Jewish people and the Holy One, Blessed be He, are united in a special unity, then the pleasure of G-d is our pleasure. And as the Halachah follows the ruling of the sages, when we say "Moshiach Now" it has to be effected, and it must come true now, without any delays!

5. When we speak of the legacy of the great sages of old, in addition to the knowledge we garner from their written works there is also much to be gleaned from studying their biographies and their talks, customs and lifestyles.

From the life story of the Rambam we may learn much. In the Rambam's Code there are two special, unique and overwhelming aspects. The first is the fact that Rambam includes all the laws of the Torah in his Code, including the laws of the Bais Hamikdosh and even the laws of Moshiach. The second is the fact that Rambam teaches us and gives the Halachic details of the Seven Noachide Laws, introducing them by stating: "Moreover Moshe, our teacher, was commanded by G-d to compel all human beings to accept the commandments enjoined upon the descendants of Noach."

Similarly, in his daily life we find his regular custom was to assist all people, Jews and non-Jews alike. There is the well-known letter of the Rambam in which he describes his difficult daily schedule and he writes: "I find all the foyers and waiting rooms filled with people, non-Jews and Jews are there ... I then go out to treat them, to write prescriptions and medical advice to heal their sickness ... till late at night ... and I reach a state of utter weakness and exhaustion."

Therefore, in addition to learning in the Code of Maimonides how one must act to improve the world and civilization we also learn a lesson from the Rambam's personal daily activity, that he toiled and dedicated his life to helping everyone, Jews and gentiles, dealing with the most basic of all assistance, their health.

Through all this work, of teaching the laws of Noach to the nations of the world, which is a preparation for the work of Moshiach, may we merit the ultimate and complete goal of perfecting the world with the fulfillment of the promise: "For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the Name of the L-rd to serve Him with one consent."
