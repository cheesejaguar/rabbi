# Jew and G-d Alone

**Occasion:** Yom Kippur
**Source:** Days of Destiny, Sichos In English

---

The chapter explores Yom Kippur's unique spiritual significance in Jewish tradition. According to the teaching, Yom Kippur achieves atonement through a mechanism distinct from repentance alone.

## Three Levels of Connection

Jewish souls maintain three levels of connection with G-d. The first two — bonds formed through mitzvos observance and deeper inner connections that enable repentance — can be affected by human actions and sin. However, the third level represents an essential unity between the Jewish soul's core and G-d's Essence, described as intrinsic and beyond human limitation.

The central claim states: "the day itself procures atonement," meaning Yom Kippur automatically reveals this essential bond, thereby cleansing soul blemishes without requiring active human repentance efforts.

## The High Priest's Service

The text references the High Priest entering the Holy of Holies, where "No man shall be in the Ohel Moed when he enters to make atonement." This symbolizes the exclusive revelation of unity between Jews and G-d on this day.

## Five Prayer Services

Yom Kippur features five prayer services corresponding to five soul levels. The final service, Ne'ilah, reveals the soul's quintessence — its highest dimension — locked in unity with the Divine Essence.

## Distinction from Other Times

While repentance can eradicate sin's consequences, Yom Kippur "transcends the entire concept of sin and repentance," offering atonement on a more exalted plane.
