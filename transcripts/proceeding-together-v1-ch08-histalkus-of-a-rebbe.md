# The Histalkus of a Rebbe

**Date:** Shushan Purim, 5710 (1950)

Those who say that *histalkus* means the Rebbe [Rayatz] is *removed* from us are "wild folk who do not know what they are saying."

The Rebbe [Rayatz] released a *maamar* for study on Yud Shvat, the day of his *histalkus*. He explains a teaching from the *Zohar*: "When the *sitra achra* is subdued, the glory of G-d rises thereby [and is diffused] throughout all the worlds." The verb here is *istalek*, which shares a root with *histalkus*. No one would understand this literally as "departure."

In the *maamar*, the Rebbe [Rayatz] explains that this phrase describes "the drawing down (or elicitation) of a transcendent level of Divine light, that which is *sovev kol almin* (encompasses all worlds)." The *Zohar* terms this *hamshachah* as *histalkus* because "this refers to the revelation of the transcendent light of *sovev kol almin* which encompasses all worlds in an exalted manner." Therefore, the same applies when *histalkus* refers to the Rebbe [Rayatz].

This concept connects with Shushan Purim. *Maamarim* of Purim relate the phrase *shoshan emek ayumah* ("Rose of the valley, standing in awe") to *keshoshanah bein hachochim* ("Like a rose among the thorns"). When a rose is concealed by thorns, its fragrance is most appreciated. Similarly, Divinity's self-concealment permits the soul's descent to the corporeal world, ultimately eliciting "a sublime irradiation of Divine light."

Nevertheless, "we want and we need the Rebbe [Rayatz] here, simply and literally, 'lower than ten handbreadths from the ground.'"

The Rebbe Maharash once asked his father, the *Tzemach Tzedek*, about 5608 [1848], described as a *keitz* [probable time for Redemption]: "How could it be that *Mashiach* has not arrived?"

The *Tzemach Tzedek* replied: "But *Likkutei Torah* was published!"

The Rebbe Maharash answered: "Yes, but we want and need *Mashiach*, simply and literally, 'lower than ten handbreadths from the ground.'"
