## Special Note on the 28 Nissan Sicha

The famous "I have done whatever I can; from now on, you must do whatever you can"
declaration of 28 Nissan 5751 (April 11, 1991) is referenced in the Yechidus of
25 Nissan (entry #9 above). Note that the 28 Nissan talk itself -- considered one
of the most significant addresses in Chabad history -- may be published in a
different volume or format. The Shabbos Parshas Shemini talk (entry #10, dated
29 Nissan / April 13) is the closest Shabbos address following this pivotal moment
and discusses related themes about every individual's power to bring about the redemption.
