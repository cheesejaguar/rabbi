## Introduction

The Rebbe states that we represent the final exile generation and thus automatically the first redemption generation, having "finished all matters of the avodah and are already standing ready for" complete redemption through Moshiach.

## The Question Posed

Some question whether the world demonstrates sufficient readiness for redemption. The concern centers on whether all nations and lands show signs of refinement necessary for complete redemption, not merely individual preparedness.

## Purpose of Exile

The Rebbe explains Jewish dispersion throughout the world serves a dual purpose: externally appearing as descent, but internally aiming to refine and elevate each land through Jewish inhabitation and adherence to local customs while maintaining Torah observance.

## France as Example

The Rebbe discusses France's transformation from being an unrefinable spiritual obstacle during the Alter Rebbe's era to a place where Jewish life flourishes. The Alter Rebbe opposed Napoleon so strongly he risked his life fleeing French rule.

## Generational Progress

Later Chabad leaders gradually engaged with France: the Rebbe Maharash visited, the Previous Rebbe delivered Chassidic discourses there, and sent family members including the Rebbe to reside there, completing the spiritual refinement process.

## Numerical Significance

"Tzarfas" (France in Hebrew) numerically equals 770, suggesting that France's refinement indicates complete worldwide spiritual preparation.

## Publicizing the Miracle

The Rebbe emphasizes recognizing and declaring Hashem's miracles as essential for bringing redemption, concluding that acknowledging worldwide readiness itself facilitates redemption's arrival.
