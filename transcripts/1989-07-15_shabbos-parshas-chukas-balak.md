This discourse explores connections between Yud-Beis Tammuz (the Previous Rebbe's redemption day) and ultimate Messianic redemption. The text notes that "The Nasi of the generation is equivalent to the entire generation," indicating the redemption affected all Jewish people, not merely one individual.

The redemption enabled spreading Chassidic teachings to America, described as "the lower half of the world." Numerology features prominently: the 12th of Tammuz represents the twelve tribes' future redemption, while 13 corresponds to divine oneness that will characterize the Messianic age.

The discourse highlights multiple factors emphasizing this connection in that particular year:

a) Yud-Beis Tammuz fell on Shabbos, which represents the Messianic age itself

b) The Torah portion (Balak) contains explicit Messianic references, as the Rambam explains regarding prophecies about the Mashiach

c) The Minchah portion (Pinchas) relates to Mashiach's coming, as our Sages identified Pinchas with the prophet Eliyahu

d) The fortieth year after the Previous Rebbe's passing carries special significance, as "G-d grants a heart to know, eyes to see, and ears to hear"

Redemption extends beyond the Jewish people to encompass worldwide elevation. The discourse analyzes the Mishnah from Shabbos Chapter 7 regarding forbidden labors -- "forty less one" categories.

The thirty-nine labors represent "the sum total of all worldly activity." When performed with proper intention ("for the sake of heaven"), these activities refine the world and transform it into "a dwelling place for G-d." The fortieth labor -- representing oneness with the divine -- becomes accessible through this refinement.

The week represents exile and "work," while Shabbos represents redemption when service focuses on "the fortieth labor, the labor of oneness."

Two labors receive special attention: sowing and transferring between domains. The prophet Hoshea references exile as sowing: "I will sow you among the nations." Similarly, transferring articles from one domain to another reflects how Jews were removed from divine protection.

These labors also symbolize future redemption: a single seed produces entire plants, suggesting "unmeasurable growth and development" in exile leads to redemption.

The Previous Rebbe's redemption occurred across two days, reflecting divine providence's wider scope:

- **12th of Tammuz**: Personal notification of release
- **13th of Tammuz**: Official government announcement (delayed due to holiday closure)

This two-phase redemption mirrors the structure: one for the individual, one for the world at large.

The Alter Rebbe emphasized how divine miracles occurred "before the officers and nations throughout the domain of the king," establishing that gentile awareness matters for ultimate redemption. When the Mashiach comes, "the entire world, including its gentile inhabitants will be refined."

The discourse notes the U.S. Congress issued an official statement praising divine salvation of the Previous Rebbe and his contributions to spreading Judaism and the seven Noachide commandments.

The Previous Rebbe worked to elevate France's spiritual status, a country the Alter Rebbe had viewed negatively. Before becoming Rebbe, he visited France and later sent emissaries and texts to French Jewish communities. Present-day efforts continue with many French Jews returning to Torah and studying Chassidic teachings.

The discourse connects current Torah portions to Messianic anticipation. Both Balak (morning reading) and Pinchas (afternoon reading) contain Messianic references.

The Rambam emphasizes that one must "wait for him to come each day." Preparation involves increasing Torah study, particularly sections addressing Messianic redemption such as the concluding chapters of Hilchos Melachim (Laws of Kings), also called Hilchos Melech HaMashiach (Laws of the Mashiach).

The discourse encourages spreading Chassidic teachings, including newly released texts of the Previous Rebbe's Sichos from 5696-5700. It suggests constructing buildings dedicated to Torah, prayer, and charitable deeds, noting the Previous Rebbe's fund supports such projects.

The coming days (13th, 14th, and 15th of Tammuz) should feature farbrengens where participants make positive resolutions in three spheres: Torah study, prayer, and kindness.

The discourse concludes expressing hope that these activities transform the fast of 17th of Tammuz into a celebration with Mashiach's arrival, emphasizing immediacy: "May it be now, immediately."
