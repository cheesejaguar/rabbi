This sicha discusses the 4th yahrtzeit of Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka on Chof-Beis (22nd) Shevat, 5752. The Rebbe reveals significant meanings about this event and its connection to Geuloh (redemption).

## Three Important Dates in Shevat

- Yud Shevat: Hilulla (anniversary of passing) of the Previous Rebbe
- Yud-Alef Shevat: When the Rebbe officially accepted leadership, inaugurating the 7th generation
- Chof-Beis Shevat: Passing of the Rebbetzin

"The ultimate [Divine] intent is that Bnei Yisroel, by their own effort and with their own power...will draw down the revelation of 11 by making the 10 (tachton) a fitting vessel for receiving this revelation."

## Two Dimensions of Divine Dwelling

The Rebbe explains there are two aspects to "a dwelling place in the lower realms":

1. A revelation of Hashem's essence
2. This revelation drawn down below

These correspond to numbers 10 (the world) and 11 (transcending world), reflecting the first and last of the Ten Commandments.

## Three Stages of Spiritual Service

**Stage One (10th of Shevat):**
Preparing the world to receive Divine revelation without being nullified. Emphasis on the receiver and the distinction between levels 10 and 11.

**Stage Two (11th of Shevat):**
Revelation of level 11 itself, elevating level 10, though the 10 loses importance relative to the 11.

**Stage Three (22nd of Shevat):**
"The perfect unity and connection -- when the 'dwelling place' is united with 'the One Who dwells' (Hashem's Essence)." This represents complete unification where "the created sense of reality is one thing with the true reality."

## Practical Application to Generations

**First Generation (Until Yud Shevat):**
Chassidim focused on personal spiritual development, studying ethics and character refinement to prepare for Geuloh. The 6th generation emphasized the distinction between the role of Chassidim and the Rebbe.

**Second Generation (Beginning 11 Shevat):**
The 7th generation's service shifts focus from personal perfection to influencing the world. Shlichus (emissarial work) becomes central, where the emissary sets aside personal spiritual goals to represent the Rebbe.

**Third Generation (After 22 Shevat):**
Focus intensifies on Moshiach with emphasis on effort "from their own effort." After Gimmel Tammuz (the Rebbe's passing), Chassidim proceed without overt revelations from the Rebbe, making his teachings their own concern.

The progression moves from "working primarily on ourselves...to nullifying ourselves...to where our reality is intertwined with the Rebbe's reality."

## Practical Example

A Chassid baking shmurah matzah for personal family use becomes a Shliach who sacrifices his holiday joy to ensure all Jews in his area have proper matzah, finally becoming unified with the Rebbe's concern so that ensuring matzah for others becomes his own personal priority.
