# Stories, Not Eulogies

**Date:** Shiva period following Yud Shvat 5710 (1950)

The Rebbe explains that Jewish law permits "three days for mourning, seven days for eulogizing." Someone had written that while chassidim don't deliver eulogies, they tell stories about the departed -- which serve as their eulogy. The Rebbe decides to tell stories about the Previous Rebbe (Rayatz) during this seven-day period.

## The Sixteen Stories

**1. In Good Hands**
When the Rebbe Rashab was gravely ill in 1897, Moscow doctors gave him months to live. His wife asked what would become of his chassidim and Chassidus. He replied by pointing to his seventeen-year-old son (the future Rayatz): "Why, I'm leaving him!"

**2. A Chassidic Kiss**
In 1884, when the Rayatz was four, his father studied with R. Yaakov Mordechai Bespalov. Seeing the sleeping child's radiant face, the chassid noted his spiritual purity. The Rebbe Rashab felt moved to kiss his son but instead decided to write a maamar of Chassidus titled "Mah Rabu Maasecha." He gave the manuscript as a gift in 1892, explaining it was "a chassidic kiss" and later told the full story.

**3. Obedience**
At age six, the Rayatz was instructed to recite a blessing over his tzitzis, though he'd already said it that morning. He refused. His father struck him lightly (the only time ever) and explained obedience was necessary. The boy tearfully replied that if a blessing must be made before G-d, he'd already done so. The Rebbe Rashab clarified: "A berachah has to be made because G-d said so, but every father watches over his children, and they have to obey him."

**4. Not So Terrible**
In his father's study, the young Rayatz discovered manuscripts by his grandfather (the Rebbe Maharash). Using a goose quill, he composed an explanation of a philosophical concept in Chassidus on one of the sheets. When his father later found it, he exclaimed, "This is a happy day; I've discovered a maamar of my father's I didn't know about!" Weeks later, the Rayatz confessed tearfully at yechidus. His father simply replied: "Not so terrible."

**5. Example**
The Rebbe Rashab sometimes instructed his son to enter his room and observe his conduct.

**6. Hand in Glove**
The Rebbe Rashab asked his son to practice copying his handwriting so letters to rabbis could be transcribed and then signed by the father. The Rayatz agreed on condition of receiving an additional regular study session in Chassidus. The Rebbe Rashab accepted, the son quickly mastered the handwriting, and the letters were sent as planned.

**7. Intercom**
A telephone connection linked the Rebbe Rashab's and Rayatz's rooms. The father would call his son saying, "You can come in; I'd like to smoke," then discuss his studies or ask what his son had to tell him. Eventually, the Rayatz kept the speaker open using a match, enabling him to hear his father pray.

**8. The Altneuschul**
During an 1908 visit to the Maharal's synagogue in Prague, the Rayatz wanted to access the attic where the golem is kept. He bribed the shammes, took a ladder, and climbed up. (When recounting this, he wouldn't say what he saw.) The Rebbe Rashab later reprimanded him severely, and after months said, "I had months of work!" -- apparently to counteract potential spiritual effects.

**9. A Few Lines of Tanya**
During the mourning year following his mother's passing, the Rayatz would lean his forehead on his hand and whisper something before saying Kaddish DeRabbanan. He eventually explained he was repeating a few lines from Tanya.

**10. Tachanun**
The Rayatz taught that in prayer services where Tachanun isn't recited, one doesn't beat one's chest when saying "Slach lanu" in Shemoneh Esreh.

**11. Relativity**
During travels abroad, the Rebbe Rashab met numerous respected rebbes. Returning home, he gave his son a silver-capped wooden cane using his last few rubles. When his wife questioned this expense, he replied that he now understood who their son truly was.

**12. Four Pairs of Tefillin**
This extensive story explains the practice of wearing four pairs of tefillin, requiring exceptional bodily purity. The Rebbe describes how R. Hillel of Paritch and others wore them, and how the Rayatz instructed him to do likewise, taking responsibility for it. The Rayatz later agreed to publicize the order in HaYom Yom. The Rebbe discusses how a verse in Psalms alludes to three of these four pairs and explains their spiritual levels, with higher pairs relating to transcendent Divine levels that don't require blessings.

**13. Machine-made Tzitzis**
Refugees in Germany after World War II asked about machine-produced tzitzis, which R. Chayim of Zanz prohibited. The Rebbe asked the Rayatz, who recalled that when refugees arrived in Russia in 1915 without prayer shawls or tzitzis, the Rebbe Rashab sent an emissary to a factory producing machine-made tzitzis and later permitted blessings over them.

**14. Silent Reverence**
The Rebbe notes he didn't observe the Rayatz adding the epithet "holy" when mentioning the author of Or HaChayim or the Shelah, even when discussing that the Alter Rebbe was a "Shelah-Jew" who prayed from the Shelah's siddur with his mystical intentions.

**15. Dreams**
The Rayatz related that as a boy, R. Yitzchak of Ruzhin would anticipate all questions that Rashi raised while learning Chumash. Reaching the verse about Jacob's ladder dream, his teacher asked why he didn't question it. The young Ruzhiner replied: "You don't ask logical queries about a dream."

**16. When You Grow Up**
When the Rayatz cried during his circumcision, his grandfather the Rebbe Maharash said: "Why are you crying? When you grow up you'll be a..., and you'll teach Chassidus articulately." The account leaves a blank space. Chassidim report the Maharash said "You'll be a Rebbe," explaining the blank.
