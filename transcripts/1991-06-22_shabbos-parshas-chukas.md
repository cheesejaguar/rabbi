Every day possesses two dimensions: its place in the weekly cycle and its place in the monthly cycle. The weekly cycle follows a Divine pattern established during creation, independent of human activity. The monthly cycle, conversely, depends on the Jewish court's establishment of the calendar.

The blessing for holidays states: "who sanctifies Israel and festive seasons," with Israel mentioned first, indicating that festival sanctity depends on Jewish court decisions. This demonstrates the spiritual task given to the Jewish people to draw down transcendent holiness into our world.

The weekly cycle expresses Divine energy invested in creation, reflecting perfection as established. Humanity, however, received the potential to elevate creation to a new and higher level of perfection. Our Sages interpreted "all that G-d created to do" as "created to improve," indicating that humans can introduce dimensions of holiness the world does not naturally possess.

These two levels correspond to the numbers seven and ten. Seven relates to the holiness of the natural order -- the Divine life-force invested in creation. Ten relates to a level transcending creation, introduced through human service.

In Kabbalistic terminology, seven reflects the seven middos (Divine emotional energies paralleled by our emotional qualities), which brought the world into being. Each creation day expressed a different middah: the first day reflected Chesed ("kindness"), the second Gevurah ("might"), continuing through the seventh day, which reflected Malchus ("sovereignty").

Ten, conversely, includes the three qualities called mochin, paralleled by our intellectual faculties. These transcend the world's present level. The intention is for humans to introduce these intellectual qualities into the world, elevating it to a higher plane.

This will be accomplished in the Era of Redemption. In ma'amarim associated with "Do not cause distress to Moav," Chassidic thought explains that in the present age, service involves refining the seven emotional qualities corresponding to the seven nations inhabiting Eretz Yisrael. In the Era of Redemption, service will focus on developing intellectual faculties corresponding to the Keini, Kenizi, and Kadmoni, the three nations whose lands will be conquered then.

These two dimensions manifest within creation itself. The Written Torah speaks of seven creation days, while the Oral Torah (this week's Pirkei Avos chapter) speaks of Ten Utterances of Creation. A parallel exists: Written Torah is given from Above, its holiness independent of human activity; the Oral Torah is revealed through human efforts, and through dedicated Torah study, one can develop previously unrevealed concepts.

Each number possesses distinct advantages. Seven represents the perfection G-d invested into creation itself. This is the world's true nature -- that it is good, its goodness an intrinsic aspect of its being. Ten refers to holiness transcending the world: "The tenth is holy," and our Sages stated that "'Holy' is a word which is unique." This holiness's uniqueness stems from human contribution.

These two levels reflect the perfections of limitation and infinity, expressing how G-dliness permeates creation and reveals itself above creation's level.

The current day -- the seventh day of the week and tenth day of the month -- reflects a fusion of both levels: transcendent G-dliness pervades the world's limits.

Ten plus seven equals seventeen, numerically equivalent to the Hebrew word meaning "good." This represents an ultimate goodness fusing the positive dimensions of both thrusts described above.

The Zohar states that all week's days receive blessing from Shabbos. These concepts highlight the nature of blessing received by the following Shabbos -- the seventeenth of Tammuz. Generally, the seventeenth of Tammuz is a fast day. This year, since the date falls on Shabbos, the fast is postponed until Sunday.

As mentioned, seventeen is numerically equivalent to the Hebrew word meaning "good." Human service brings about an ultimate goodness dimension, transforming seemingly negative factors and revealing inner positive qualities.

A fast day's inner dimension is that it represents "a time of will." This reflects the fact that in the Era of Redemption, all fasts transform into festivals and celebration days. This indicates how even undesirable events occurring on these fast days express the great love G-d holds for the Jewish people. To use an allegory: it is like a king personally washing filth from his child.

The seventeenth of Tammuz's positive dimension is openly revealed this year when that date falls on Shabbos. Fasting is forbidden on Shabbos. Instead, it is a mitzvah to indulge in physical pleasures, eating and drinking festively. When the seventeenth of Tammuz falls on Shabbos, the holiness from Above associated with number seven is revealed, and simultaneously, there is a transformation -- at least on that date -- of undesirable elements associated with that day into good, demonstrating positive qualities contributed by human service, the quality of ten.

Except for Yom Kippur, all fast days are Rabbinic in origin. This implies that the Torah, described as "the Torah of kindness," views the world positively and therefore does not see great need for fasts to facilitate human atonement. Even Yom Kippur is primarily positive, reflected in its association with the verse "to give them life through famine" -- although a "famine" day, it grants us life.

The Rabbis, conversely, recognized that "our evil deeds and those of our ancestors, which resemble our own, brought about these difficulties for them and for us." Hence, they established fasts "to arouse hearts and open paths of repentance." Through this repentance, humans and the world reach a higher level than before the sin.

The Torah reveals the good present within creation. Through the Rabbinic tradition -- revealing human input -- we can express a deeper, inner goodness involving the transformation of undesirable influences.

We can appreciate Shabbos's potential to postpone a fast. Shabbos is associated with revealing good and pleasure from Above in a manner preventing fasts. When the seventeenth of Tammuz falls on Shabbos, there is also revelation of goodness associated with the service of ten. Instead of fasting, there is a mitzvah to delight in Shabbos and take pleasure in food and drink. This serves as preparation for when the fast transforms into a celebration day in the Era of Redemption.

This is accomplished through blessing granted by the Shabbos of the 10th of Tammuz, for the fusion of ten and seven on this Shabbos allows for the seventeenth of Tammuz's transformation when it falls on Shabbos.

The above concepts relate to this week's Torah portion, Parshas Chukas. This portion begins "These are the statutes of the Torah...." Although the passage describes only one mitzvah -- the Red Heifer -- it is still called "the statute of the Torah," because the entire Torah's service is alluded to in microcosm within this mitzvah.

The Red Heifer service involves two movements: ratzu and shuv. Burning the heifer alludes to ratzu -- the Jewish soul's yearning to unite with G-d. Placing water in a vessel refers to shuv -- efforts to draw G-dliness into the world and make it a dwelling for Him.

There is a parallel between ratzu and shuv movements and the previously described concepts of seven and ten. Ratzu reflects the desire to rise above our world's limitations, thus relating to the level of ten, which also reflects perfection transcending natural limits. Shuv involves service within the world, paralleling the level of seven associated with perfection within nature.

The ultimate service level reflects both movements' fusion: One's yearning to transcend body and world limits must combine with awareness of G-d's desire for a dwelling created for Him on this plane. Conversely, service drawing G-dliness into this world must occur with awareness that "By force, you live" -- the soul's natural yearning is to rise above the body, and only for fulfilling G-d's will does one remain on this material plane.

There is also connection to the holiday of Yud-Beis-Yud-Gimmel Tammuz, the festive commemoration of the Previous Rebbe's redemption from prison, occurring in the coming week.

The power to reveal the levels of seven and ten in the world stems from achievements in the Torah realm, as indicated in the Zohar's teaching: "The Holy One, blessed be He, looked into the Torah and created the world. A mortal looks into the Torah and maintains the world."

The two levels of seven and ten (beyond their connection to Written Torah and Oral Torah mentioned above) parallel two Torah disciplines: Nigleh, Torah's revealed dimension -- the law body -- and P'nimiyus HaTorah, Torah's inner, mystic dimension -- the Torah's soul.

Nigleh deals with practical directives for deed and action in the world at large, thus relating to G-dliness enclothing itself within natural order's limits (seven). P'nimiyus HaTorah deals with inner dimensions of soul and world, thus relating to G-dliness transcending the world (ten). P'nimiyus HaTorah grants us the potential to appreciate the inner positive nature of existence elements not appearing outwardly good.

P'nimiyus HaTorah's ultimate revelation will occur in the Era of Redemption (alluded to by conquering the Keini, Kenizi, and Kadmoni lands mentioned above). We have been granted a foretaste of that revelation in the last several hundred years. The AriZal declared that "It is a mitzvah to reveal this wisdom," and the Baal Shem Tov began the service of "spreading the wellsprings outward." The Chabad Rebbeim enclothed these truths in an intellectual framework allowing more individuals to grasp them. Each subsequent generation has seen greater spreading and simultaneously greater P'nimiyus HaTorah revelation.

Although there has been a spiritual level decline in successive generations, it is precisely because our service is carried out on the lowest level that these transcendent Torah levels are being revealed. Service in exile's darkness -- drawing out the deepest dimensions of a Jew's spiritual potential -- prompts these light revelations. Thus, as exile descent continues, there is greater and more inclusive revelation of Chassidus's wellsprings.

This relates to Yud-Beis Tammuz's redemption, for that event sparked increased service of spreading Chassidus wellsprings outward. Moreover, it ultimately led to the Previous Rebbe coming to America, marking increased service. Indeed, Chassidus's revelation and spreading extent since then far exceeds previous generations' efforts.

This potential emanates from the Previous Rebbe's redemption, for as Rashi mentions, "The Nasi is the entire people." The entire people, particularly those who saw the Previous Rebbe in person -- for seeing a Nasi powerfully affects those beholding him -- derive inspiration and strength from him.

These efforts' effects increase year after year. Particularly in the last several years, an abundance of Chassidic teachings previously reserved for select few have been published and disseminated. Even previously unknown ma'amarim have been published. (Great is the merit of all those who through efforts and/or financial support made these teachings available to others.)

These teachings' spreading leads to Divine influence revelation that essentially transcends the world (the level of ten). Particularly, Chabad Chassidus teachings, which enclothe these transcendent concepts within intellect's limits, grant the potential for creating G-dliness vessels within the world and transforming it into a dwelling for Him (the level of ten permeating the level of seven).

This service serves as preparation for ultimate revelation -- the reward for "spreading the wellsprings outward," which is -- as the Mashiach told the Baal Shem Tov -- the Future Redemption. Then we will see the ultimate fusion of transcendent (ten) and natural-order-invested (seven) G-dliness.

The above concepts must be reflected in every person's individual service. A person must engage in both services mentioned above: revealing the G-dliness invested within the world at large and drawing down transcendent G-dliness.

Both services are alluded to in the declaration Modeh Ani that a Jew makes upon arising every morning. We thank G-d for returning our souls -- acknowledging the G-dly life-force invested within us -- and state "great is Your faithfulness" -- expressing awareness of a G-dliness level "great," i.e., above our ordinary limits.

More explicitly, these two services feature in our morning blessings. The morning blessings thank G-d for material gifts He granted us, and afterward, we proceed to Torah blessings, describing a G-d bond higher than nature, as our Sages commented "the Torah preceded the world."

Afterward, these two thrusts feature throughout our daily service. Certain conduct elements involve refining and elevating the world while others involve spiritual service transcending the world's limits -- Torah study and mitzvos observance.

Such twofold service's necessity is appreciated by everyone, even young children. Everyone realizes he has a body deriving nurture from physical activities and a soul, a spiritual entity above the body. The body is obviously limited, while the soul's nature transcends our perception limits.

Within the soul itself, there are different levels. There is an inner dimension manifest in the deepfelt longing with which a person desires certain things. There is an external soul dimension where desires are not as powerful. The external soul dimension is limited, while the internal dimension is boundless. Each day, we must endeavor to fuse these two dimensions on all these levels.

In practice, this should entail making efforts to study daily portions of Nigleh and P'nimiyus HaTorah. Particularly, we should increase tzedakah gifts, including not only deed tzedakah, but tzedakah on the level of speech and thought, thinking and speaking favorably about other Jews.

Similarly, regarding Yud-Beis-Yud-Gimmel Tammuz, efforts should organize farbrengens in each place where Jews gather to inspire each other in the service of spreading Chassidus wellsprings outward. This will generate potential for transforming the Three Weeks into a positive period, with the ultimate Redemption's coming. Even before that redemption comes, we will merit successive Divine miracles. When one Jew asks another "What was the last miracle that happened," he will be unable to answer because miracles are occurring in such rapid succession. These miracles will lead to ultimate miracles accompanying exodus from exile, when "As in the days of your exodus from Egypt, I will show you wonders."

## Harmony Between Body And Soul

Yud-Beis and Yud-Gimmel Tammuz, the festive anniversary of Previous Rebbe's redemption from prison and exile, is associated with the spiritual task of spreading Chassidus wellsprings outward. Every year this holiday's celebration grants new energy for carrying out this service. A fitting expression for this is for every individual to enhance his Torah observance in the following manner.

Beyond one's daily study sessions, one should add -- each person according to his capacity -- a special study session in Nigleh (revealed Torah law dimensions) and a special study session in P'nimiyus HaTorah (Torah's inner mystic dimensions). One concept in each study field should be studied with in-depth concentration.

This is relevant for every Jew -- man, woman, and child. Even a young child appreciates having a body, an aspect governed by material existence's natural limits, and a soul, a spiritual entity transcending those limits. Correspondingly, there is "Torah's body," Nigleh, the Torah aspect relating to the world's limits, and "Torah's soul," P'nimiyus HaTorah, transcending those limits.

Our bodies and souls are interrelated. Thus, it is preferable that the two studies fuse together -- studying a concept where Nigleh and P'nimiyus HaTorah join. This entails learning a concept's simple meaning according to Torah law, then delving into its inner spiritual meaning. Such study potential is found within all Chabad Rebbeim teachings in successive generations, particularly in several recently published teachings.

This should lead to performing mitzvos behiddur -- in a beautiful, conscientious manner fusing body and soul -- i.e., the mitzvah's intent (its soul) should be revealed and emphasized together with the actual deed (its body). This should motivate us to perform mitzvos exceeding minimal law obligations.

Particularly, this should be expressed in the tzedakah mitzvah. We should increase actual tzedakah gifts (the mitzvah's body) and increase the warmth and care with which we give it (its soul). As an expression of the mitzvah to "Love your fellowman as yourself," these suggestions should be passed to others who should be motivated to participate in these activities.

May these efforts enable us to proceed from Yud-Beis and Yud-Gimmel Tammuz's redemption to the complete and ultimate Redemption, which will reveal the Three Week period's inner, positive nature. As we progress to that Redemption, we will merit a multitude of miracles -- a never-ending succession of Divine wonders leading to ultimate wonders we will witness with the prophecy fulfillment: "As in the days of your redemption from Egypt, I will show you wonders," with the ultimate Redemption's coming. May it be in the immediate future.
