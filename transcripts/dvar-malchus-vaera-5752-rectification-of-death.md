The sicha discusses a Talmudic statement regarding dying on Erev Shabbos (the eve of the Sabbath). The Rebbe explores why the sages teach that "one who dies on Erev Shabbos, it is a good sign for him," seemingly paradoxical given that death represents the opposite of life and good.

## The Gemara Reference

The passage describes a conversation between R' Yehuda haNasi and R' Chiya, where R' Chiya provides signs portending favorable outcomes after death, including: dying amidst laughter versus crying, and dying on Erev Shabbos versus after Shabbos.

## The Fundamental Question

The Rebbe asks: "How is it possible to truthfully say (in Toras Emes, the Torah of truth) that 'one who dies on Erev Shabbos it is a good sign for him'" when death contradicts the fundamental Jewish understanding of good?

## The Answer: Rectification

The Rebbe explains that the "good sign" indicates the rectification of death's negative aspect. This parallels Adam Harishon's sleep before creation of Eve -- a temporary concealment (histalkus) preceding greater revelation of life-force.

## Historical-Cosmic Parallel

The model extends to world history: the sixth millennium corresponds to Erev Shabbos, preceding the seventh millennium (ultimate Shabbos). This era involves concealment preparing for resurrection of the dead.

## Dual Explanations

**First:** The principle "Yaakov Avinu did not die" teaches that through descendants' continued Torah observance, the ancestor's eternal existence becomes revealed specifically after physical passing.

**Second:** Death's concealment prepares for Techiyas Hameisim (resurrection), enabling "life of a soul in a body in eternal life" surpassing pre-death existence.

## Application to Righteous Individuals

The Rebbe notes that unique individuals have already experienced this transition, fulfilling the obligation for all Israel. Therefore, the rest of Jewish people need only undertake spiritual "death" -- self-nullification (bittul) -- without literal physical passing.

## Conclusion

"Death on Erev Shabbos (the 6th millennium, our times) is only a concealment as a preparation for a revelation of a higher level of life -- eternal life of the soul in the body, in the ultimate state of perfection!"
