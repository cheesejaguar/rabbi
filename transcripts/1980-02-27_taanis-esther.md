## Purpose of the Fast

The Rebbe explains that community leaders historically addressed congregations on fast days "to motivate his listeners to Teshuvah" (repentance). He notes that while all fasts share the common intent of spiritual improvement, each fast possesses distinct characteristics based on timing, prayers, and name.

## Two Interpretations of the Fast

The address presents two differing views: one connects the fast to the 13th of Adar war preparations, while another traces it to Esther's three-day fast mentioned in the Megillah. The Rebbe harmonizes these perspectives, demonstrating how both natural effort and divine blessing work together.

## Practical Application

The Rebbe emphasizes that "deed is most essential" and calls for intensified action in spreading Purim observances, particularly to underserved populations in institutions and among Israel's defenders. He lists eleven specific campaigns (Mivtzayim) for community engagement.

## Unique Timing

Since Purim falls on Shabbat that year, the fast is observed on Thursday the 11th, providing three days of preparation instead of one and allowing Friday for Shabbat preparations.
