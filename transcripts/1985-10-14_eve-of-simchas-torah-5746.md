We have discussed the relative superiority of the rejoicing of Sukkos as compared to the joy of the other festivals. In this respect there is an even greater measure of rejoicing during the holiday of Shemini Atzeres which becomes even more intense on Simchas Torah.

While happiness is the underlying theme of all the festivals, it is to the holiday of Sukkos that we attach the appellation, "Season of Our Rejoicing," whereas Pesach is called, "Season of Our Freedom," and Shavuos is known by the name, "Season of the Giving of Our Torah."

In addition to this specific theme of rejoicing on Sukkos, when Shemini Atzeres begins, we consider it a new holiday and we recite the blessing "Shehecheyanu ... who has granted us life." It is in appreciation of the renewed joy of the new holiday that we actually recite this blessing, (see Shulchan Aruch, Laws of Sukkah ch. 641) which leads us to the logical conclusion that the rejoicing on Shemini Atzeres must be greater than on Sukkos.

We may consequently deduce that when we recite the "Shehecheyanu" on Simchas Torah we are once again acknowledging an increase of joy!

Although the holiday of Simchas Torah would normally be considered as the "Second day of the Diaspora," which was originally instituted by the sages because of the doubt of the correct date, nevertheless, in modern times when all dates are calculated according to the fixed calendar, it has come into its own. Thus, the second day of the holiday has been accepted as a custom which was established and not rescinded; in fact, in the diaspora we observe several customs on Simchas Torah which are not carried over from Shemini Atzeres.

A proper Jewish custom takes on the validity of Torah. Thus the Shehecheyanu on Simchas Torah is said in appreciation of the additional practices of Simchas Torah and for the increase of rejoicing, relative to the joy of the previous holidays.

The attribute of happiness exists at all times of the year and in various different degrees and ever-ascending levels:

The joy of creation.

The Talmud relates:

All creatures of creation were brought into being in their full knowledge. (Rosh Hashanah 11a)

Rashi explains:

They were asked whether they wanted to be created and they said: "Yes." (Rashi, loc. cit.)

Thus, there is an essential gladness in being created. This, of course, takes on a double gladness; that of Creator:

May the L-rd find delight in His works. (Tehillim 104:24) As a gratification of spirit before Me -- that I commanded [the creation] and My will was carried out.

(Rashi, Shemos 29:18)

And that of created (Man):

The Jews should rejoice in their Maker. (Tehillim 149:2)

The joy of fulfilling the mitzvos.

Observance of mitzvos must include joy, as the Rambam rules:

Rejoicing in the fulfillment of a commandment and in love for G-d who had prescribed the commandment is a supreme act of Divine worship ... as it is said: "Because you did not serve the L-rd your G-d with joyfulness and with gladness of heart." (Devorim 28:47) ... "King David leaping and dancing before the L-rd" (Shmuel II, 6:16).

(Laws of Palm Branch 8:15)

In this celebration of religious duty there are also the two aspects mentioned above: The Holy One, Blessed be He, is happy that we fulfill His command, and we rejoice in that we have brought satisfaction to G-d. Thus, all through the year, in every mitzvah we do, there is an increased awareness of joy.

The unique ecstasy of observing mitzvos whose essential theme is rejoicing.

If every mitzvah includes delight, how much more joy will we experience in doing those activities which are inherently acts of rejoicing!

When the Torah commands us: "Rejoice in your festivals," and when Sukkos is referred to as the "Season of Our Rejoicing," we can understand how intense and great the joy of Shemini Atzeres, and subsequently Simchas Torah must be; the summum bonum of joyfulness.

There is an additional facet and implied emphasis which applies to the joy of mitzvos and especially the special mitzvos of rejoicing.

When the Rambam describes the aspect of cheerfulness in religious duty he refers to it as a "supreme act of Divine worship" -- "Avodah Gedolah."

Tanya discusses the category of "One who is serving G-d (Oved Hashem)" and explains:

This will explain the statement in the Gemara that "One who is serving G-d" refers to him who reviews his lessons 101 times ... because that
