## 1. On the Name "Terumah"

The Baal Shem Tov taught that a thing's essence appears in its Hebrew name. The Torah portion's name, "Terumah," means contribution, yet the term applies to various types of contributions including Challah separation. This raises the question: why use such a general term for the specific contributions toward Mishkan construction?

Furthermore, the name seems contradictory to the portion's essence. The Mishkan's purpose involves Divine Presence descending from above, as expressed: "They shall make Me a Mishkan, and I shall dwell within them." This depends entirely on Divine intervention.

By contrast, "Terumah" carries two meanings: to separate and to elevate -- both representing human capability within limited powers. Man can separate and elevate his possessions toward G-d's service, yet these remain "within the limited powers granted to man and are a direct result of his own efforts."

This seeming contradiction resolves through understanding that Divine revelation at Sinai represented sudden, total transformation. However, creation's true purpose involves "the transformation and elevation of the physical into spiritual" through "the efforts and deeds of the physical world itself." This step-by-step service -- separating and elevating physical materials -- represents humanity's gradual partnership with the Divine.

The portion discusses "the physical contribution which Jews gave" rather than the Divine Presence that subsequently rested there. Thus "Terumah implies" the "separation and elevation" of thirteen to fifteen material types toward Mishkan construction.

## 2. Study of Mishkan Construction Details

One might question the relevance of studying ancient Mishkan construction details that will never recur. However, the Torah remains eternal; all Mishkan aspects exist spiritually in every Jew's service. "The prayers were instituted to replace the offerings," reflecting identical conceptual foundations. Every Jew possesses "the strength and ability to relive the contributions" and "erect a Mishkan of his own."

## 3. The Three Primary Metals

The Torah enumerates materials in specific order, beginning with gold, silver, and copper. Someone might rationalize contributing only "copper," representing lower service levels, postponing "gold" and "silver" until achieving greater capability. The Torah responds by beginning with gold, reflecting the ruling that one must contribute "from the choice and from the beautiful" of one's possessions.

Conversely, someone might wish elevating only gold, refusing to descend toward copper's lower creation levels. Torah instructs that G-d wants humanity to "descend even to the level of the deep pit" and establish Divine dwelling there.

## 4. Shabbos Hafsakah -- The Interval Shabbos

This Shabbos represents "Shabbos Hafsakah -- the Shabbos of interval," when none of the four special Parshahs are read, interrupting the sequence between Parshas Shekalim and Parshas Zachor. Though appearing negative -- merely absence -- it represents a positive Torah concept. The Sifra notes that spaces between Torah sections allowed Moshe Rabbeinu to meditate between chapters, as each new chapter revealed higher levels than its predecessor.

Since "we always ascend in matters of holiness," each new chapter required preparation. These intermissions enabled reception of higher revelation levels. Moshe continued Torah study during these periods, but "in comparison to the previous level of learning Torah from G-d they are considered intermissions."

This illuminates a puzzling Talmudic passage: "When R. Zeira emigrated to Eretz Yisrael, he fasted a hundred (or according to another version forty) fasts to forget Talmud Bavli." One questions how this violates the Torah study obligation. The explanation parallels Moshe's experience -- R. Zeira fasted to reach the "higher level of learning Talmud Yerushalmi," not literally forgetting previous learning. The fasting period, compared to actual prior study, represents "forgetting," yet this intermission proved necessary for attaining higher understanding.

## 5. The Menorah's Weight -- Understanding Rashi's Commentary

The Torah states the Menorah should be crafted from "a Kikar of pure gold." Rashi explains: "That its weight should only be, together with all its vessels, but one talent, neither less nor more. Now the ordinary talent (weighed) sixty manehs, but the sacred (talent) was double (that), one hundred and twenty manehs."

This commentary presents perplexing aspects. Why does Rashi specify exact weight when other Torah weight references receive no such explanation? Why doesn't Rashi explain the sela's worth regarding first-born redemption, which occurs more frequently?

Additionally, Rashi's opening and subsequent explanations form separate logical units wrongly combined. The verse mentions talent weight before discussing vessel construction, yet Rashi reverses this order.

The explanation recognizes that Rashi wrote for Hebrew-speaking students including five-year-olds learning Torah. Rashi never translates familiar terms -- children understand "kikar" as a "piece," just as "kikar of bread" means a loaf. The child cannot comprehend how an entire Menorah with knobs, flowers, cups, and vessels could be constructed from one gold "piece."

Therefore, Rashi recounts the kikar's enormous value, explaining that a maneh equals the weight used in Cologne, familiar to children in Rashi's time and place. Only after understanding the Menorah must come entirely from this single kikar does the child's question arise -- "how is this possible?" -- which Rashi then answers by detailing the kikar's substantial size.

Rashi omits the sela's worth in first-born redemption because this remains irrelevant to children's understanding, unlike the Menorah's seemingly impossible construction from a single gold measure.
