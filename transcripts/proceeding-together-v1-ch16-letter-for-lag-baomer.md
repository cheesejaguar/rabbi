The letter begins by referencing the Zohar's account of R. Shimon bar Yochai's passing on Lag BaOmer. On that day, Rashbi opened his discourse with the verse "I am my Beloved's, and His desire is towards me," stating that throughout his lifetime he had "been united in a perfect bond with the Holy One, blessed be He."

The author explains that when the Zohar describes someone "opening" a discourse, it signifies the mentor creating a conduit for Divine blessings and enlightenment. This allowed others to access these spiritual gifts. During Rashbi's generation, even young children could grasp Torah's mystical dimensions because he had opened this channel of transmission.

The letter acknowledges that reaching Rashbi's spiritual level seems impossible, yet God revealed the teachings of Chassidus through the Baal Shem Tov and subsequent Rebbeim, including the letter's author's father-in-law. Chassidus provides pathways enabling individuals to approach holiness and "serve G-d with his brain and with his heart," each according to their capacity.

The text emphasizes that Lag BaOmer annually renews these spiritual conduits. This anniversary date is particularly suited for strengthening one's study of Torah's inner dimensions and spiritual service, as these channels remain open until the Messiah arrives.
