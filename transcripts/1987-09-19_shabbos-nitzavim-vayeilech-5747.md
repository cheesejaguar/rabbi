The portion starts by saying "Today you are all standing before Hashem." It is explained in Likkutei Torah (41a) that this portion is always read before Rosh HaShanah. "Today" hints to Rosh HaShanah. This means to say that today all categories of Jews are united to such an extent that there is no high or low, they are all standing before Me equally. This is in a general way.

In a more specific manner they are united through a covenant, referring to teshuvah. Just as, for example, a covenant is made between two friends that the love between them should never end. Even though there may be ups and downs in their feelings, their relationship is never severed. So too, our relationship with Hashem, through teshuvah, is never severed.

This is why it is called "to cut a covenant." This is similar to dividing one thing, then both parties pass between the two halves. Through passing between one body they become united.

In a similar manner is the covenant that Jews and Hashem make on Rosh HaShanah when we become one with Hashem. Since this is a time when Jews become united with Hashem on a very high level, we have the ability to crown the king through the blowing of the shofar. As it says (Tanya p. 162) "There can be no king without having a nation first." This crowning is also effected in the upper worlds. The revelation of kingship above is specifically through Israel, which is affected through shofar, bringing about teshuvah, returning to the king. This reoccurs every year on Rosh HaShanah.

This has a special uniqueness this year since it is a Shemittah year, and Rosh HaShanah is in a year of Hak'hel. Therefore the above mentioned service is in a much stronger manner. This is because during a Shemittah year we are totally given over to Hashem. Hashem should be recognized in the whole world, even in the work in the field. In addition, a Hak'hel year, which is a year of the gathering together of men, women and children, achieves unity similar to the unity that is achieved on Rosh HaShanah.

May it be, that through the service mentioned above that this reading of the Torah should be through Moshiach himself. May he come speedily in our days.

The Previous Rebbe's statement is known concerning the uniqueness of this Shabbos, the last Shabbos of the month of Elul. The Alter Rebbe once retold that "When I was in Mezeritch I heard from the Maggid and from the Baal Shem Tov that the seventh month is the first month, of the months of the year. Hashem Himself blesses this month, which is the last Shabbos of the month of Elul. With this energy we have the ability to bless the rest of the eleven months of the year."

In connection with the portion of the week: "You are all standing before Me," refers to Rosh HaShanah, that is a time of judgment. "You are gathered, existing, and standing," meaning to say that we merit to have a positive judgment. This portion is read before Rosh HaShanah, and included in it are the blessings that Hashem gives for the whole year.

This blessing is a general blessing, but nevertheless it is not given to remain general, but rather should be brought down in a specific, detailed way into the world. This in turn effects an increase also in the general blessing.

Not only this world is judged, but all the spiritual worlds are also judged. On the contrary, the order of the drawing down this blessing starts with the upper worlds and then comes down to this world. Nevertheless, the ultimate purpose of this flow is for this physical world. Specifically here is where Hashem will be revealed, and His will fulfilled.

We also see that in mitzvos, action is the main thing. Even if a person did a mitzvah without the proper intention (spiritual) he still has performed his obligation to do the mitzvah. The intention alone, without the action, has accomplished nothing. So we see, the only purpose of spirituality is for this physical world and action.

Still, the proper intention is required, although not for the intention's sake, rather for the sake of the action. Because the intention adds an essential aspect, that being the excitement in the doing of the mitzvah. The sages say "a mitzvah without intention is like a body without a soul."

The relationship between the general and the detail is hinted to in relation to the three fathers of Chassidus. The Baal Shem Tov and the Maggid brought out Chassidus in a general manner that not everyone understood. The Alter Rebbe, on the other hand, brought out Chassidus in a detailed way, meaning he brought general Chassidus down to the level where physical intellect could also understand it. This revelation of the specific also effects an elevation in the general.

To connect this with the portion of Nitzavim: "all of you where commanded today." The quote starts out in a general way "all of you" and then goes on to specify "from the leaders," "to the water carriers." All this is in order to "enter into the covenant of Hashem". After entering into the covenant they all reach a much higher level of unity with Hashem.

This unity is achieved specifically through teshuvah. And in particular through the blowing of the shofar, through which one reaches a supernal level of teshuvah.

This "detail" of teshuvah was also emphasized by the Alter Rebbe, who clarified Chassidus by bringing it down into the world, in that he concerned himself with making baalei teshuvahs.

It also should be added that teshuvah is also found among tzaddikim. Even if one's service to Hashem is proper, but nevertheless one's subjugation to Hashem is not total, on a very refined level this is considered rebelling against the king. Therefore there has to be teshuvah also in this case.

The culmination of this will be in the future world, when the whole creation will reach perfection. This will be much higher than even the perfection that was found in the beginning of creation. This will even include the perfection of Adam and Moshe, both of which were on very high levels, yet they still will be able to reach even higher. This will occur because Hashem's will, of having a dwelling place in this world, will be fulfilled.

Being that "Action is the main thing," therefore through all that was mentioned above Moshiach should come now.

The 25th of Elul emphasizes the many details of the creation, and afterwards Rosh HaShanah nullifies all these differences and brings out that they are really one. The difference between the 25th of Elul and Rosh HaShanah is brought out even more in this year, being that the 25th of Elul is a Shemittah year, and Rosh HaShanah is a Hak'hel year. This is because Shemittah emphasizes many details and Hak'hel emphasizes unity.

A Shemittah year, relating to the service of a person, is concerned with the service of a Jew in elevating and purifying the world (details). He makes his field into public property so that in this way he recognize the true owner of the field, being Hashem.

The mitzvah of Hak'hel brings out the nullification of the person to Hashem (general). Meaning to say that all Israel; men, women, and children, do one mitzvah together. In addition, the purpose of this mitzvah is to fear Hashem. The main emphasis is not on the learning and understanding of Torah, which lead to different levels of understanding, rather only to fear Hashem. This, being the entire purpose of mitzvos in general.

May it be that everyone will fulfill all the matters connected with the last Shabbos of Elul. Everyone should make a true accounting, and mending of the passing year in preparation for the new year. All these matters should be achieved through happiness. As it is known "Happiness breaks boundaries." This will quicken the breaking of the limitations of the exile, and bring the redemption through the righteous Moshiach. Then we will merit to actually perform the mitzvah of Shemittah, and even more so the mitzvah of Hak'hel in the third Beis HaMikdash speedily in our days.

In the sixth chapter of Pirkei Avos (Mishnah 2) we are taught: "The Tablets were the work of Hashem, and the writing was the writing of Hashem, engraved (charus) on the Tablets. Do not read charus (engraved) but charus (freedom), for there is no free man except for one who occupies himself with the study of Torah."

The Tzemach Tzedek explains that "the first Tablets were created by Hashem, therefore no nation could have ruled over the Jews. Which is not true of the second Tablets. Nevertheless, since they were also engraved by Hashem, and also come from a place of freedom, which is why they were given on Yom Kipper a day of the revelation of a very high level in G-dliness, therefore anyone who is involved in Torah is a free man."

This matter also emphasizes the point that a general rule includes also the details. The true meaning of freedom is not just in a general way, rather freedom has to apply to all the details. This means to say that the freedom that one person has is not true freedom. True freedom would only be when he has no interference or worries during his Torah studies. If this is not the case, even in one detail, this would be a contradiction in freedom.

Concerning today's lesson in Rambam (Avos HaTumah chapter 15): We learn the greatness of a minyan (congregation). The connection of this to these days of preparation to Rosh HaShanah and the ten days of teshuvah is: We see that also regarding the ten days of teshuvah the greatness of a congregation is emphasized.

Since action is the most important thing, we should make use of all the extra capacity of a congregation in order to increase in all things that are relevant to this time: To complete the accounting of the soul for the whole year that has past, being a Shemittah year, and to prepare for the coming year, a Hak'hel year.

We should also carry out the desires of the Previous Rebbe including the spreading of Chassidus. Through the doing of all this we should merit to the coming of Moshiach quickly in our days.
