# Mikeitz - At the Root of It All

**Source:** Likkutei Sichot, Volume VI, Sichos In English

---

In the beginning of *Parshas Mikeitz,* the Torah elaborates on the story of Pharaoh's dreams, relating that he dreamt of cows and ears of grain. Afterwards, the Torah relates Yosef's interpretation of these dreams, that they refer to years of plenty and years of famine.

One might ask: Why does the Torah describe Pharaoh's dreams at such length? What is important for us is the outcome -- that Yosef informed Pharaoh of the upcoming years of plenty and years of famine, and for this reason was appointed viceroy of Egypt. What difference does it make to us whether this happened as a result of a dream or through some other medium?

The answer is that the Torah tells us that Pharaoh was informed about the future through a dream, in continuation -- and as a consequence -- of Yosef receiving information concerning his own future through a dream.

Yosef the *tzaddik* was a comprehensive soul. His mission was to draw down the totality of Yaakov's spiritual influence into this world. Yosef was "the *tzaddik,* the foundation of the earth," and he thus served as the medium through which was conveyed all the Divine influence to be dispersed throughout the world. Since spiritual truths were revealed to him through a dream, this became the pattern for the world at large.

This provides us with a lesson in our Divine service. When a Jew is challenged by base attitudes and desires, he must realize that they stem only from himself. We do not have to follow the lead of the world at large, nor should we adopt the view that in order to observe the Torah and its *mitzvos,* we must adapt ourselves to our environment.

The opposite is true. The existence of the world depends on the Jewish people. It is because a Jew has adopted a particular attitude or has a particular desire that these attitudes and desires exist in the world at large. And when a Jew exchanges his undesirable attitudes and desires for good ones, similar changes will be effected in the world at large.

## What Yosef Sees in His Dreams, and What Pharaoh Sees

Although Pharaoh's dreams thus have their source in Yosef's dreams, they are of a fundamentally different nature. Yosef's dreams reflect the realm of holiness, and Pharaoh's the realm of *kelipah.* This is indicated by certain fundamental differences between them.

a) Yosef's dreams begin with work: "We were in the field binding together sheaves." Pharaoh's dreams, by contrast, do not involve any activity on his part. In the realm of holiness, work is necessary; otherwise, the influence received would be "bread of shame." In the realm of *kelipah,* influence is granted unearned, for the recipient is not an entity of genuine worth.

b) Yosef's dreams follow the pattern of "Always ascend higher with regard to holy matters." In the first dream, separate entities are bound together into sheaves, and the second dream proceeds to the celestial plane, speaking about the sun, the moon, and the stars.

The dreams of Pharaoh, by contrast, follow a downward trend. The first dream concerns cows, members of the animal kingdom, and the second concerns ears of grain, plants, which are on a lower level. Furthermore, even within each dream the pattern is one of decline. First Pharaoh saw healthy cows, and then lean ones.

## Growth Orientation

This reflects the difference between the realm of holiness and the realm of *kelipah.* The realm of holiness is characterized by eternality, and unchanging permanence. There are variations, but these reflect a tendency toward growth: "Always ascend higher with regard to holy matters," and "They shall go from strength to strength."

*Kelipah,* by contrast, is characterized by change and decline. The reason is because *kelipah* does not have a self-contained purpose for its existence. The entire reason for its being is to present a person with a challenge, and thus spur him to summon up deeper resources of holiness. The more steadfast a person remains, the less he needs external challenges to push him forward. Thus the existence of *kelipah* becomes weaker, following the pattern which our Sages outlined: "When one ascends, the other descends."

## Reaping What One Sows

The second point -- that a Jew's achievements come through work -- is also of fundamental importance. There are times when a person thinks he will receive certain blessings without any labor on his part. He must know that this approach comes from his animal soul, which stems from *kelipah,* since only *kelipah* can receive influence without work. And he must understand that any blessings which he *does* receive in this manner will -- like everything that has its source in *kelipah* -- follow a pattern of decline, and ultimately disappear.

When, by contrast, a person dedicates himself to serious work, he will merit fulfillment of the promise "You labored and you discovered." He will achieve success far out of proportion to the amount of effort invested. And this will inspire continued growth, following the pattern: "Always ascend higher with regard to holy matters."
