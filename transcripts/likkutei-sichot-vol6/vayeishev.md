# Vayeishev - Two Dreams, Two Messages

**Source:** Likkutei Sichot, Volume VI, Sichos In English

---

The beginning of this week's Torah reading relates Yosef's two dreams. The meaning of the two dreams is the same. They both allude to the fact the Yosef would be granted dominion over his brothers, and that they would bow down to him. Later, in *Parshas Mikeitz,* the Torah relates that Pharaoh also had two dreams. In this instance as well, both dreams had the same meaning. With regard to Pharaoh's dreams, however, the Torah tells us why the dreams were repeated, to show that the events alluded to were imminent. With regard to the repetition of Yosef's dreams, by contrast, the Torah does not give an explanation.

This implies that the two dreams, although sharing the same general meaning, reflect two different concepts.

## A Jew's Dreams Differ From those of a Gentile

The difference between Yosef's two dreams can be explained as follows: the first concerned material objects; he and his brothers were binding sheaves in the field. The second dream involved the sun, moon, and stars -- objects in the heavenly sphere.

Pharaoh's dreams, by contrast, both concerned worldly matters. One involved ears of corn (i.e., plants), and the other cows (the animal kingdom). Pharaoh did not, however, have any conception of the heavenly realm. Moreover, even with regard to worldly matters, his dreams followed a downward trend; first he dreamt about the cows and afterwards about the ears of corn. Yosef, by contrast, followed the pattern: "Always ascend higher with regard to holy matters." Thus he first dreamt about material matters, and then about heavenly matters.

This points to a larger difference between Jews and non-Jews. Even while a Jew is involved with material concerns, he is living on two planes simultaneously. Not only is he involved with this physical world, he shares a connection to the spiritual truth of the World to Come.

My revered father-in-law, the Rebbe, once expressed this concept as follows: When he was arrested in 5687, one of the Russian officers threatened him with a revolver. The Rebbe answered him: "Only those who have many gods and one world will be frightened by such an article. A person who has one G-d and two worlds is not frightened at all."

## Fusing the Material and the Spiritual

The fact that Yosef had two dreams, one concerning material matters and another concerning heavenly matters, yet both bearing the same message teaches every Jew to fuse both of his worlds -- the material and the spiritual -- into a single entity. Not only should a Jew's material concerns not hinder his Divine service, they should *complement* that service. Indeed, the material should become one with the spiritual.

This thrust is a natural tendency in the makeup of every Jew, even simple people, as reflected in the following story.

When they were young children, the Rebbe Rashab and his brother Reb Zalman Aharon were arguing about the difference between Jews and non-Jews. To provide them with an answer, their father, the Rebbe Maharash called his attendant Reb Ben Tzion, a simple Jew with little Torah scholarship.

"Ben Tzion, did you eat today," the Rebbe asked him.

"Yes."

"Did you eat well?"

"What do mean 'well?' Thank G-d, I'm satisfied."

"Why did you eat?"

"In order to live."

"And why do you live?"

"To be a Jew, and to do what G-d wants," the attendant answered, sighing slightly.

Afterwards, the Rebbe Maharash told his children: "Do you see? A Jew's inherent nature is to eat in order to live. And he lives in order to be a Jew and do what G-d wants. And he gives a sigh because he feels that in truth he is not living according to these values in a complete sense."

Moreover, since a Jew's desire and intent is that all of his material concerns be connected with the spiritual, they are indeed considered as such. As the Baal Shem Tov would say: "Wherever a person's desire is, there he himself is to be found."

## Three Themes in Our Divine Service

What constitutes a Jew's work? Binding together sheaves. Every stalk of grain is a separate entity, growing in its own place. Man's service involves joining together these distinct entities into larger composites, sheaves.

Where is this activity carried out? "In the field," an analogy for our material world. A Jew's soul descends into this world, the field, which is characterized by separation. It is the realm of *kelipah,* as reflected by the description of Esav as "a man of the field."

As the soul descends into this world, it becomes enclothed in the body and the animal soul. The latter are characterized by an awareness of self, and of one's distinction from others. The soul's task "in the field" is to nullify this sense of self and separation engendered by the animal soul, and to bring together all its potentials in the service of G-d.

This cannot be done unless "your sheaves... bowed down to my sheaf"; the brothers must bow down and negate themselves before Yosef *HaTzaddik.*

The entire Jewish people can be described using the analogy of a large body. In the human body, there are three organs, the brain, the heart, and the liver, which control the functioning of the whole, and all the other organs must allow themselves to be controlled by these three. Similarly, it is not sufficient for a person to carry out the service of "binding together sheaves in the field." Even after a person himself becomes "a sheaf," he must negate himself before the "sheaf" of Yosef *HaTzaddik,* the Rebbe, the leader of the generation, the head of the Jewish people. The leader gives directives for the entire Jewish people and controls their functioning, as a head controls the function of all the body's limbs and organs.

## Crowning Efforts

We can summarize the lessons taught by Yosef's dreams as follows. First and foremost, work is necessary. Effort and labor are the rungs of the ladder by which a Jew can ascend and establish a connection with G-d. Although Jews are "sons of kings," and indeed, "kings" themselves, this does not mean they need not expend effort. On the contrary, all the influence received in the realm of holiness comes through work. Nevertheless, since we are speaking about "kings," every small effort is counted as if it were strenuous labor. And in return, G-d will grant "the feasts of Shlomo at the height of his reign," and even more. But still, effort is required.

We are promised, however, "If you labor, you will find," i.e., you will attain accomplishments that you could not have expected previously. Indeed, the attainments will be far out of proportion to one's efforts, lifting one to the highest spiritual rungs.

The second directive is that, regardless of one's level of Divine service, all of one's efforts should be accompanied by a commitment of self-nullification to the leader of the generation.

And when a person "nullifies his own will," G-d "will nullify the wills of others before your will."
