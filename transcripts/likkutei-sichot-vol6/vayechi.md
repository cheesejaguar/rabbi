# Vayechi - Seeing the Spiritual Mirrored in the Physical

**Source:** Likkutei Sichot, Volume VI, Sichos In English

The conclusion of Parshas Vayechi relates that Yosef communicated the message of redemption to the Jewish people, telling them: "G-d will surely remember you, and will bring you out of this land." This shows that not only was Yosef the cause of the descent to Egypt, he was also the initiator of the exodus. Yaakov and his sons came to Egypt because of Yosef, and it was he who gave the promise and the sign for the redemption. Moreover, this sign was more than a mere symbol; it empowered the Jews to proceed until the time when "[G-d]... will bring you out of this land."

## Yosef's Uniqueness

Chassidus describes Yosef's advantage. The Patriarchs and Yaakov's sons were shepherds, living apart from the pressures of material concerns so that they would not interfere with their Divine service. Yosef, by contrast, served as a viceroy, a task which involved many time-consuming activities. Moreover, he held this office in Egypt, a land described as "the nakedness of the earth." Nevertheless, this did not prevent Yosef from clinging to G-d in a perfect bond.

This explains why "Yosef recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him." Yosef's brothers could not conceive that Yosef HaTzaddik could possibly be the viceroy of Egypt. According to their conception of Divine service, involvement in worldly affairs and closeness to G-d were mutually exclusive. Thus the phrase "they did not recognize him," can be interpreted to mean that they had no appreciation of the lofty level at which Yosef functioned.

On this basis, we can also appreciate the interpretation of the verse: "This is the posterity of Yaakov. Yosef...," It is Yosef who draws the spiritual influence of Yaakov into the lower realms. Yaakov functioned in the realm of Atzilus. Yosef transferred this influence to the worlds of Beriah, Yetzirah, and Asiyah, and more specifically into our material world.

Yosef was the one able to accomplish this, because with regard to this task, he was on a higher spiritual level than Yaakov. For this reason, he was able to communicate with the lower levels, as it is said: "It is that which is on the highest levels which can descend to the lowest levels."

## The Parallel Between the Divine Service of the Patriarchs and Yosef, and the Three Pilgrimage Holidays and Shemini Atzeres

The Zohar states that the three pilgrimage festivals correspond to the three Patriarchs. Pesach corresponds to Avraham, Shavuos corresponds to Yitzchak, and Sukkos corresponds to Yaakov. Shemini Atzeres corresponds to Yosef, "the posterity of Yaakov," just as Shemini Atzeres is a continuation of the holiday of Sukkos.

With regard to Shemini Atzeres, we find a contradiction. On the one hand, it is considered a festival in its own right. And yet the very name Shemini Atzeres, lit. "the assembly of the eighth day," implies that it is a continuation of the holiday of Sukkos.

The explanation is that the connection between Shemini Atzeres and Sukkos parallels that between Yosef and Yaakov. Yosef is an extension of Yaakov; his contribution represents the transmission of Yaakov's influence into the lower realms. The ability to transmit this influence, however, is something which Yaakov himself does not possess.

The holiday of Sukkos represents an encompassing light, just as a sukkah encompasses the people who dwell within. Shemini Atzeres makes it possible to internalize the influences of Sukkos. This is implied by the name Atzeres, which means "gathering in," collecting and concentrating. The fact that Shemini Atzeres makes it possible for these influences to be internalized indicates that in itself it possesses a more powerful potential.

## The Significance of the Number Eight

There is another factor which reflects the connection between Yosef and Shemini Atzeres. The number eight reflects a light that transcends the limits of the natural order, going beyond the limits of Seder HaHishtalshelus, the chainlike progression of spiritual worlds.

The natural order is structured in sets of seven; the number eight reflects a light that transcends these limits. This light is revealed on Shemini Atzeres. And because Shemini Atzeres is associated with a transcendent light that is not confined by any limits whatsoever, it can allow for the internalization of the spiritual influences which are so lofty that they can be revealed on Sukkos only in an encompassing manner.

We find a similar concept with regard to the mitzvah of circumcision, which is carried out on the eighth day of a child's life. Through the mitzvah of circumcision, our physical flesh is refined and brought into an eternal bond with G-d. The level of eight which shines on Shemini Atzeres is associated with Yosef, who is described as "the tzaddik, the yesod of the world."

## At the Vortex of the Dynamic of Redemption

The intent of the descent into and exodus from Egypt was to gather the wealth of Egypt, i.e., to refine the sparks of holiness which were enclothed in that land. When the Jews completed this task, redemption came.

Our Sages state that the redemption from the Egyptian exile came about through the merit of the blood of circumcision and the blood of the Paschal sacrifice. For the intent of the mitzvah of circumcision is to elevate the lowest levels, the organ which is identified with "Yesod, the end of the torso."

The potential to descend to the lowest levels and elevate the sparks of holiness found there comes from Yosef HaTzaddik. So the Egyptian exile came about because of Yosef, and he was the one who communicated the message of redemption. For he was the one who endowed the Jewish people with the strength to carry out the purpose of the exile, completing the task of refinement, and in this way preparing for the redemption.

## The Power to Greet Mashiach

With regard to the future redemption, it is written: "As in the days of your exodus from Egypt, I will show you wonders," establishing a parallel between the two redemptions. Accordingly, like the Jews in Egypt, our Divine service in these final stages of the exile is to elevate the remaining sparks of holiness which have fallen to very low levels.

Our Divine service involves taking the deepest spiritual truths, the mystical secrets of the Torah, and disseminating them to the ends of the earth, following the directive given to the Baal Shem Tov by Mashiach: "When your wellsprings spread outward...."

Through these efforts, even the lowest sparks of holiness will be elevated, and this will bring about Mashiach's coming, here in this material world. May it be in the immediate future.
