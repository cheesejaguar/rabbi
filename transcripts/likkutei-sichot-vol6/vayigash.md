# Vayigash - Yosef's Message

**Source:** Likkutei Sichot, Volume VI, Sichos In English

---

When Yosef revealed his identity to his brothers, he told them:

> G-d has sent me ahead of you to secure a remnant for you on the earth, and to grant life for you with great deliverance. And now, it was not you who sent me here, but G-d. And He has had me appointed.... a ruler throughout the land of Egypt.

Yosef informed his brothers that he had been brought to Egypt for a Divine purpose: so that Yaakov and his family could endure the famine. And he continued by telling them to inform Yaakov his father that "G-d has made [him] a lord over all of Egypt," and to "come down to me, do not delay."

This sequence indicates that the descent of Yaakov and his family into the Egyptian exile depended on Yosef's position as ruler of the land. Yosef was not merely informing his family that the Divine Providence which had guided him was also the cause of their move to Egypt. He was hinting at the fact that by making him ruler over Egypt, G-d had made it possible for the purpose of the Egyptian exile to be fulfilled.

## The Wealth of Egypt

In the covenant *Beyn Habetarim*, G-d told Avraham that his "descendants will be foreigners in a land that is not theirs for 400 years. They will be enslaved and oppressed... and afterwards, they will depart with great wealth." The promise that the Jews would "leave with great wealth" was not given merely to afford some comfort during the oppression they suffered; it related to the very *purpose* of the exile.

## Spiritual Wealth

The descent into Egypt was thus intended to refine and elevate the sparks of G-dliness that existed in that country. Through their many years of labor, the Jews were able to refine and cull the sparks of holiness enclothed in the land's material substance. And when they left Egypt, they elevated these sparks of G-dliness to their source.

This leads to a larger concept. As the Baal Shem Tov taught, a Jew's material possessions are of spiritual importance. It is in this vein that he interpreted our Sages' statement: "The Torah shows consideration for the wealth of the Jewish people." A Jew's property is very dear, the Baal Shem Tov explained, for in it are enclothed sparks of holiness which the Jew must elevate to their source.

## Shaping Destiny

Every spark of holiness is destined to be refined by a particular soul, and conversely, every soul has certain sparks of holiness which it is destined to refine, for these souls and these sparks share an inherent connection to each other.

This is the inner meaning of our Sages' statement: "A person will never take a portion designated for a colleague." This is true with regard to physical matters, because of the spiritual dynamic described previously. The spiritual profit -- the Divine sparks enclothed in the material property -- is destined to be elevated by only one person.

My revered father-in-law, the Rebbe, once explained at length that with Divine Providence, G-d structures the events of the natural world to enable a Jew to encounter the sparks he is to refine. As long as the person does not elevate the sparks destined for him, they remain in exile. And since the sparks connected with a person's soul are found in exile, the soul itself is in exile.

Moreover, the refinement of these sparks of holiness involves the essence of a person's soul. Since "an essence cannot be divided," any portion of it, however small, encompasses the whole. As the Baal Shem Tov said: "with regard to the essence, if you grasp a portion of it, you are attached to it in its entirety." Thus when even a few of the sparks related to the essence of a person's soul remain in exile, the essence of that soul is also in exile.

## Purpose Within Exile

Since Egypt is the prototype of all subsequent exiles, the concept explained above provides guidelines for us in this final exile. The intent of exile is not merely to punish us for our sins. Instead, the ultimate purpose is the elevation of sparks of holiness. In this vein, *Chassidus* offers an extended interpretation of our Sages' statement: "The Holy One, blessed be He, exiled the Jews among the nations only so that converts would join them," explaining that "converts" also refer to the sparks of holiness within material entities.

Hence we must also follow the pattern that "A woman should borrow from her neighbor and she who lives in her home." "A woman" is an analogy for the soul, which is commanded by G-d to be concerned with another objective besides leaving exile. It must "borrow... articles of silver and gold," taking with it the sparks of holiness which are found within the body, the animal soul, and one's portion in the world.

G-d's command is that we must take out of exile not only those sparks of holiness with which we are constantly in contact, but also those which we encounter less often.

From these material concerns should be fashioned "articles of silver and gold." Silver refers to love, and gold to fear. One's efforts to refine one's environment should enhance and be encompassed by one's Divine service of love and fear.

## No Room for Nearsightedness

There are those who protest: "Why must I be concerned with exile? I want nothing to do with it. I am willing to forego the 'great wealth.' And I am even willing to forego the spiritual fulfillment which refining the exiled sparks of holiness would bring my soul. What I *don't* want is to have to struggle against the two-fold darkness of exile, and concern myself with material matters. I would rather sequester myself in a world of Torah study and prayer."

Such a person must know:

1. If he does not complete the task assigned him, his soul remains in exile. Moreover, his hope of sequestering himself in Torah study and prayer can be realized only with regard to his revealed powers of intellect and emotion. The essence of his soul, however, will remain in exile together with the sparks of holiness which he was to have elevated.

When a person gives this even a little thought, he will be motivated to shoulder the portion of the task of refinement allotted to him, for "A person will give everything he has for the sake of his soul." How much more so does this apply when the *essence* of the soul is involved!

2. Even were a person able to leave exile himself and attain high peaks of spirituality without participating in the task of refinement, of what value would these peaks be? And how can they be considered as "peaks of spirituality" if they are attained by resisting G-d's will? For He and His will are one.

This is one of the lessons to be learned from the exile and the exodus from Egypt. Our Divine service must involve our worldly environment, refining the sparks of holiness that exist within exile. And then "they will empty Egypt," leaving it "like a silo devoid of grain and a net devoid of fish," elevating all the good which exists within our environment and taking it with us as we go to greet *Mashiach* here, in this material world. May it be in the immediate future.

## Establishing a Torah Center

On the verse, "And he sent Yehudah before him to Yosef to show the way to Goshen," *Rashi* comments in the name of the *Midrash* that the implication is that he sent Yehudah "to establish a house of study from which *halachic* judgments would be issued," i.e., before Yaakov travelled to Egypt, he sent Yehudah to found a *yeshivah.*

This teaches us that before a Jew arrives in a new country, he must first see to it that the land will be a center for Torah. For the Torah is the source of life and posterity for the Jewish people, and for every individual Jew.

Nevertheless, the question arises: Why was it necessary for Yaakov to send a special agent, Yehudah? Yosef was already in Egypt; why couldn't *he* establish this center?

## Two Plains of Connection

This question can be answered by differentiating between the spiritual levels of Yaakov, Yosef, and the other brothers. Yaakov and his other children lived out of contact with the day-to-day realities of this world. They were shepherds, choosing this occupation in order to minimize their contact with the material world, so not to be distracted from Torah study and Divine service.

Yosef, by contrast, from his youth onward did not work as a shepherd. After being sold as a slave in Egypt, he was occupied with running Potifar's affairs. The dimension of G-dliness which is too uplifted to serve as a source for material existence illuminated Yosef's life. As such, worldly concerns were of no significance to him, and therefore it was impossible for worldly matters to affect his bond with G-d.

This represented a higher level of connection than that experienced by the Patriarchs or Yosef's brothers. They also experienced an overt revelation of G-dliness, but they were exposed only to those dimensions of G-dliness which enclothe themselves in the world. For that reason, they had to serve as shepherds lest material involvement disrupt their bond with G-d.

## Single-Minded Devotion

Yosef's elevated spiritual plane reflected the nature of his soul. With regard to Torah study, however, different principles apply. For with regard to Torah study, what is most important is that a person be one with the Torah he studies. As such, it is a person "whose Torah is his livelihood," one who has no concern other than the study of Torah, who gives the most complete expression to this thrust in Divine service.

Therefore, when a person combines Torah study with any other concern -- even though while involved in those concerns he remains "a chariot for G-dliness" -- he is diminishing his bond with the Torah.

## Why Yehudah and not Yosef

Based on these concepts, we can understand why Yaakov had to send Yehudah to establish a Torah center in Egypt, and could not rely on Yosef to accomplish this task. Although Yosef was always at one with G-d, clinging to Him in a complete bond, this bond was a reflection of the higher plane on which his soul functioned. With regard to the study of Torah, however, since he was the viceroy of Egypt, and had to attend to all the business concerns of the land, he was not able to devote himself to study with the commitment of one "whose Torah was his livelihood."

Thus although with regard to his own personal mission, there was nothing lacking in Yosef's Divine service, he could not serve as a paradigm for Torah study. To maintain the world at large -- for Torah study is one of the "three pillars on which the world stands" -- it was necessary for Yaakov to send Yehudah. For Yehudah was a shepherd, living apart from worldly concerns. His was the personality necessary to establish a *yeshivah* and Torah center in Egypt, where students would not be distracted by any other concerns.

## Not Only a Story of the Past

*Yeshivah* students must know that Torah study should be their sole concern; they should not be involved with anything else. Of course, they will also be involved in *gemillus chassadim,* deeds of kindness, for *gemillus chassadim* is a fundamental requirement for Torah study, as our Sages commented: "Whoever says, 'For me, there is nothing aside from Torah study,' will not even possess [the advantage of] Torah study." Without being coupled with *gemillus chassadim,* the study of Torah is lacking.

Nevertheless, these efforts should not disturb a student's inner bond with the Torah. On the contrary, the intent should be to *enhance* Torah study. For it is through studying the Torah in this manner that the existence of the world will be maintained.
