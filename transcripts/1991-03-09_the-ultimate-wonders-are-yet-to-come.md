Publisher's Foreword

As a preface to this essay, we would like to reprint a portion of the Publisher's Foreword to the essay entitled "The Message of the Year 5751," which Sichos In English published on 5 Kislev, 5751 (November 22, 1990).

Well before this year began, people of all walks of life have again been looking forward with impatient anticipation to see what this new year holds in store. For the Rebbe Shlita has repeatedly said* that the letters ַ"ֹײ�'ה (5751) stand for the words, אַֹ�ַ �ֹײ ַה� 'כה

�אַמצֹ -- "This will surely be a year when '[G-d] will show you wonders.' " Here again it is clear in everyone's mind -- that this is no mere play on words. As the present essay records, the Rebbe Shlita sees a direct connection between the international events which are engaging the earnest concern of the world at large, and the teachings of the Sages in the Midrashic work entitled Yalkut Shimoni.

On 24 Teves, 5751 (January 10, 1991), we published an essay entitled "Every Jew Has a Silver Lining," which reassured Jews of all degrees of spiritual attainment that they surely deserve a future free from fear. Subsequently, on 28 Teves, 5751 (January 14, 1991), we published an essay entitled "The Safest Place in the World," conveying a message of support and hope for Eretz Yisrael. And on 8 Adar, 5741 (February 22, 1991), we published an essay entitled "Purim Miracles Today," associating the events in the Gulf with the Purim festival.

In grateful appreciation of the miracles we have witnessed, we would like to publish the present essay, based on a public address on Shabbos Parshas Vayakhel-Pekudei (23 Adar, 5751/March 9, 1991), in which the Rebbe Shlita assures us that "the ultimate wonders are yet to come."

Towards the end of last year, it was announced that the Hebrew letters numerically equivalent to the date of the present year 5751 (ַ"ֹײ�) form an acronym for the words �ֹײ ַה� 'כה

�אַמצֹ אַֹ�ַ -- "This will surely be a year when 'I will show you wonders.' "[61]

At that time, we saw the beginning of a chain of events that gripped the attention of the entire world, reflecting the prophecies of our Sages in the classic text, Yalkut Shimoni. That text relates that:

In the year that Mashiach will be revealed, nations will challenge one another. The King of Paras will challenge an Arab king... and the entire world will panic and will be stricken with consternation... Israel will also panic and will be confounded.[62]

Wonders that Compel You to Take Notice

In light of the above, the promise conveyed by the name of the year became even more significant. The phrase, "I will show you wonders," implies that not only will miracles take place, but that their wondrous nature will be openly revealed. Our Sages consider the possibility that, although a miracle transpires, "the person to whom the miracle occurs does not recognize it."[63] In contrast, the nature of the miracles which we will be shown this year will force us to appreciate their wondrous nature.

And on Purim, we saw a climax of such miracles.[64] The individual who personally threatened the Jewish people was routed entirely, to the point where he had to flee for his own life. The war which was touted to become the most horrible of all wars took far less time and cost far fewer casualties than could ever have been expected. The wondrous nature of these events defies all explanation.

Furthermore, this miraculous sequence did not end with the cessation of the hostilities. Even afterwards, we saw the Iraqis undergo a turnabout that was totally out of character for them, publicly expressing regret for their conduct and returning the prisoners and the property they had taken. Indeed, they returned more prisoners than they were known to be holding.

Focusing our Attention on G-d's Hand

Adequate attention is not being paid to these miracles. Although their nature is such that even the popular media throughout the world took note of this miraculous sequence, there is a need for clearer focus. As the impact of the miracles recedes, there is a tendency to offer rationales and explanations for what has happened; i.e., that there were superior arms, superior planning, and the like.

We must publicize that these are miracles which were performed by G-d and which came as a result of this being a year when "I will show you wonders." This will lead to a recognition that "sovereignty is the L-rd's,"[65] allowing the nations of the world to recognize and to acknowledge G-d's presence. In a complete sense, this awareness cannot come about through bloodshed and destruction, but rather must be taught. By peacefully spreading the message of G-d's sovereignty, the Jews will help the nations of the world attain their desired spiritual fulfillment.

This Miraculous Sequence is Not Over

The Jews have no need to fear the aftermath of this war. Indeed, the wonders will continue. We will see even greater miracles, miracles which will cause the gentile nations to acknowledge G-d's providence and to recognize that He controls not only the spiritual realms, but even this material world.

Miracles in Our Conduct

May we be able to focus our attention, not on wars between the nations of the world, but rather on the wars of Torah; i.e., on the vigorous debates in which Torah sages sharpen each other's minds. These are wars which, as our Sages say,[66] will end in love, as seen in the relationship between the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel.

The miraculous sequence we have witnessed reflects how dearly G-d loves every Jew. May we appreciate that lesson and reach out to our fellow Jews in love, caringly showing them their place in their Jewish heritage, providing every Jewish child with a Torah education. Similarly, this awareness should motivate us to help our fellow Jews in their material concerns, in particular providing them with their needs for the forthcoming Pesach holiday. The wondrous nature of the present year also demonstrates how -- if we dedicate ourselves to these activities -- they will produce success which exceeds all possible expectations.

May these activities hasten the fulfillment of the promise in the passage from Yalkut Shimoni cited previously:

[G-d] will tell His people: "My children, have no fear. Whatever I have done, I have done only for your sake. Why are you afraid? Have no fear: the time for your redemption has arrived!" Mashiach will stand on the roof of the Beis HaMikdash and proclaim, "Humble ones: The time for your redemption has arrived!"
