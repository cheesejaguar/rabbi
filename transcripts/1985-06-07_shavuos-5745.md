1. The Men of the Great Assembly formulated the text of the holiday Amidah as well as the Kiddush that is recited at the beginning of every festival. The text reads: "And you, L-rd our G-d, have given us in love, festivals for rejoicing (L'simchah), holidays and seasons for gladness (L'sasson)."

The Amidah prayer, being so thoroughly sanctified, does not have extra words merely because of poetic license. Clearly, when the liturgy was formulated there was a specific meaning and hence, a unique theme, intended in each of the phrases: (1) festivals for rejoicing (simchah), (2) holidays and seasons for gladness (sasson).

Let us analyze the terms simchah and sasson.

Superficially we will discover that simchah usually indicates revealed joy, while sasson indicates hidden happiness. Chassidus says that "Simchah is thoroughly revealed and sasson remains in the heart." With this in mind we would probably deduce that sasson and simchah are really the same emotion: the first, when it is still submerged, the second, when it becomes revealed.

This, however, would cause difficulty in explaining the sequence of the verse "festivals for simchah," followed by "holidays and seasons for sasson." If you already have the revealed joy of simchah, what will be added by sasson?

We may clarify this by referring to the Gemara in tractate Sukkah: "There were once two Minim (sectarians), one was called Sasson and the other Simchah." Each argued his superiority over the other.

In an exegetic discussion of the verse, "The Jews had light and rejoicing (simchah) and gladness (sasson) and honor," the Gemara states: "Simchah means a feast day (Yom-Tov). Sasson means circumcision."

Festive days and circumcision are two completely unrelated subjects. From this we may deduce: simchah and sasson are not just two states of the same thing -- revealed and hidden; there really is a difference in their intrinsic and inner being. Simchah is essentially associated with external factors. Sasson is essentially tied to internal factors. As a result, simchah is extroverted, while sasson is introverted.

This fits well with the association to Yom-Tov and circumcision. Yomim Tovim are basically an external observance: "Rejoice in your holidays" -- "There is no rejoicing without meat and wine"; down to earth, physical celebration. Sasson refers to the inner hidden aspects, such as Bris Milah; "I am glad at Your word," this is the inner joy and contentment of fulfilling the command of the Holy One, Blessed be He.

What is the actual theme of the "Season of the Giving of our Torah"? To influence the physical world; that the corporeal existence shall become an object of holiness.

Mattan Torah innovated the union of the sublime and the nether, in the order of: "And I will begin." For the Torah tells us that "G-d came down on Mount Sinai." Mount Sinai remained here and was not sublimated, but G-d descended and caused a unity of physical and spiritual, so that now through mitzvos we can also convert the physical to spiritual.

This discussion will bring us to the understanding that the joy of the "Season of the Giving of our Torah" must penetrate the physical and must be evident and obvious by everyone in the expression of clapping his hands and dancing on his feet.

One might argue that his joy stems from Torah study. "The mandates of the L-rd are upright, rejoicing the heart." Rather than finding joy in eating meat and wine he will rejoice in studying a Chassidic discourse. Tell him to clap his hands and dance? "Why even a child can do that, it is not fitting for me!"

Well, it is for this individual that the prayers of the day direct us to the inner meaning of "The Season of the Giving of our Torah" -- "Torah must act in the world." The joy must penetrate the simple physical action and must burst forth in exuberance and outward rejoicing. Don't close your eyes in meditation, open them and see if your feet are dancing!

If despite this clear directive, there is a person who thinks, "How can I shame myself -- I know my greatness in Torah -- I will make a fool of myself by clapping and dancing." The answer is that you are not the first one. What does the Prophet tell us about Dovid Hamelech? When Michal, daughter of Shaul, saw Dovid dancing in front of the Ark she was displeased: "How honored was today the King of Israel, who exposed himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants."

Was Dovid intimidated? No! "And if I be demeaned more than this and be abased in my own eyes yet of the maidservants of which you have spoken, with them will I get my honor."

The Rambam includes this in his Halachah, and this becomes the eternal teaching. Now should anyone question how a respected Jew can dance and hop and clap and rejoice -- let it be known that a great Jewess already asked the question and Dovid, King of Israel, answered it.

May G-d grant that these words will lead to action, and that everyone will rejoice and dance in a manner of "hopping and dancing before the L-rd" with rejoicing and gladness of heart.

2. On the holiday of Shavuos there is a special emphasis placed on the number three, as the Gemara relates: "Blessed be the Merciful One, who gave a three-fold Torah to a three-fold people through a third-born on the third day of separation in the third month."

To this we may add another three-fold subject related to Shavuos: the three general "shepherds" of the Jewish people: Moshe, our teacher, who received the Torah from Sinai, Dovid Hamelech, who died on Shavuos and the Baal Shem Tov, who likewise died on Shavuos.

The content of today's study section in Tanya discusses the continuous creative force of the Holy One, Blessed be He, in all existence. It goes on to say that if the letters of the Ten Utterances were to be removed from the universe even for one instant it would all revert to absolute nothingness as it was before the six days of creation.

This concept reveals for us an important lesson in our Divine service. Although the creation of the lower worlds came about through intensely restrictive condensation, nevertheless, "The Holy One, Blessed be He, yearned to dwell with his creations in the terrestrial regions." Through the action of Torah and mitzvos on the part of man here below, G-d finds a dwelling place in the lower worlds.

Our directive and mission and the purpose of our existence is to serve our Maker and create an abode for the Shechinah in the lowest of all worlds, this physical "world of action."

Let us take the enthusiasm of the "Season of the Giving of our Torah" and generate it throughout the whole year, that all aspects of our lives should be permeated with the Season of Torah to make a "Torah world."

3. I have received a letter from someone who writes that he often meets misnagdim who don't "hold" by Lubavitch and they ask, "Why does Lubavitch announce, 'We Want Moshiach Now!'?" They intimate that since they are not Lubavitchers they don't have to say "We Want Moshiach Now." He goes on to request advice on how to answer them.

Ponder on this for a moment. Belief in the coming of Moshiach and longing for his coming is a basic principle of our faith. "I believe in the coming of Moshiach ... I await his coming every day," is one of the 13 principles of our faith.

Every Jew prays daily: "Speedily cause the scion of Dovid Your servant to flourish ... for we hope for Your salvation every day."

Is it possible, that with all this there are still fools who say that the request and cry that "We Want Moshiach Now" is an innovation of Lubavitch!?

Lubavitch is not ashamed of such an accusation. On the contrary, happy are we that we have merited such importance. But it is important to negate the argument that this is something new!

And if not the Tehillim, then certainly the daily prayer: "Speedily cause the scion of Dovid Your servant to flourish ... we hope for Your salvation every day!" Can it be more explicit and clear?! Are they not paying attention to the meaning of the words they say?!

May G-d grant that by discussion of this matter we will skip to the actual coming of Moshiach: "And the glory of the L-rd shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the L-rd has spoken it." With happiness and gladness of heart.
