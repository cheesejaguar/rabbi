# A Tree of the Field

**Occasion:** Tu B'Shevat
**Source:** Days of Destiny, Sichos In English

---

The fifteenth of Shevat marks Rosh HaShanah for trees, with significance for Jews who are spiritually compared to trees. As stated in Torah, "For man is as a tree of the field."

A tree's lifecycle — from seed through growth, maturation, and fruit-bearing — mirrors human development. For Jews, the "fruit" represents Torah and mitzvos. Just as trees require continuous nourishment from their roots, Jews must remain spiritually connected to Torah and Judaism to avoid spiritual decline.

## The Seven Species and Torah Study

Tu B'Shevat is celebrated by eating fruit, particularly the seven kinds with which the Land of Israel is blessed: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and dates. Bread (from wheat/barley) symbolizes Torah's revealed dimension — essential study required of all Jews. Fruit represents the mystical dimension, traditionally limited to select scholars but now obligatory for all, as the Alter Rebbe established.

## Customs and Pleasure

Though not mandated by Written or Oral Law, eating fruit on this date reflects a Jewish custom. Customs carry special spiritual significance because they exceed minimum requirements, bringing pleasure to both Creator and practitioner.

## Complete Service

The fifteenth falls when the moon is full, symbolizing complete Jewish service to G-d. This teaches that spiritual growth should never plateau — like the moon's phases, Jews must continuously develop their practice.
