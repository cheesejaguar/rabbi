# Moshiach's Seudah

**Occasion:** Last Day of Pesach
**Source:** Days of Destiny, Sichos In English

---

The last day of Pesach celebrates the final redemption through Moshiach, contrasting with the first day's commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. This connection was explained by the Tzemach Tzedek: "The first day of Pesach is Moshe Rabbeinu's festival; the last day of Pesach is Moshiach's festival."

## The Concept of "Gatherer of All Camps"

The tribe of Dan marched last in the desert and served as the "gatherer of all the camps," restoring lost items. Similarly, the final day of Pesach allows Jews to rectify any spiritual deficiencies from the entire festival. This principle extends to all generations -- our current generation is described as the "footsteps of Moshiach," the final generation of exile that completes the collective Jewish mission of elevating and refining the world.

## Symbolism and Customs

The last day represents the eighth day of circumcision following the birth of the Jewish nation at the exodus. The Baal Shem Tov initiated the custom of Moshiach's seudah (festive meal), and the Rebbe Rashab later added four cups of wine, representing various redemptive themes including the four expressions of redemption and the revelation of G-d's Name.

The meal itself transforms abstract belief in Moshiach into concrete action, with the food becoming part of the body and infusing physical existence with messianic faith.
