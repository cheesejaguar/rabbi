The 12th and 13th of Tammuz are the days associated with the redemption of the Previous Rebbe, and the 12th is also his birthday. Since tonight joins these two days together, we should begin this gathering with Torah from the Previous Rebbe, in particular that which he said in connection with his redemption.

The Previous Rebbe wanted that his Torah should be learned and clearly understood; that it should increase the learners' capability; and that it should be publicized to others. He wanted Torah to become permanently engraved in one's mind and soul, and that it lead one to make good resolutions regarding practical action.

This was the goal of the recent reprinting of the discourses of the 12-13th of Tammuz -- to encourage people to learn them. We will therefore begin by mentioning these discourses. The first one, "Havaye Li B'ozri," was said on the 12th of Tammuz in 5687 (1927) and the second, "Boruch HaGomel," on the 13th, and their openings speak of redemption and of the idea of a birthday.

One of the reasons this collection of discourses is so special is because it was said after the redemption. This bears resemblance to the Chassidus which was taught by the Alter Rebbe after his release from imprisonment in Petersburg on the 19th of Kislev. The Alter Rebbe was a great leader and spread much Chassidus even before his incarceration. But, as is well known, after the 19th of Kislev his Chassidus developed to the extent that, in the words of the Rebbe Rashab, the true "spreading of the wellsprings" began only after that time. The same degree of growth applies to the redemption of the 12-13th of Tammuz, and therefore the discourses said immediately after his release are uniquely special.

The special quality of this year is that it is the 60th year since the original redemption. We see the significance of the number 60 in Jewish law in the laws of kashrus. When some non-kosher food accidentally falls into a vessel of kosher food, the mixture is kosher only if there is 60 times more of the kosher.

The lesson is that even when there is something negative, it is considered not to exist once there are 60 positive things to outweigh it. And even if it is "liquid" -- i.e. was done with enthusiasm and his entire being -- it nevertheless becomes nullified once there are 60 positive things to outweigh it. The same applies in the 60th year from the redemption, which has the power to nullify anything negative which might have existed.

One might ask: here we have only one year, not 60 together. The 60 parts of kosher food will nullify the one only when they are all together! In reality, however, one has all 60 years together. One is not allowed to forget any Torah which he has learned, and therefore has the cumulative benefit of all his Torah knowledge. In the same way, the additional blessings and capabilities we draw from the Previous Rebbe are not lost, and have accumulated over the last 60 years to now be at our command.

Another detail of the laws of "nullification" is that something which has special status can never be nullified, even if there is 60 times more of the kosher substance. The lesson to be derived from this is that when a person has the negative trait of arrogance, it is not nullified even when there are 60 times more positive aspects. The reason for this is that G-d says, "He and I cannot exist together" simultaneously. An arrogant person feels a sense of self-importance, and considers himself to be an independent existence. This is the same idea as idolatry -- that there is an existence other than that of G-d.

This is particularly important at the present time, when there is an unprecedented lack of ahavas Yisrael. Such actions constitute a direct war against the Previous Rebbe, who worked tirelessly for the spread of ahavas Yisrael and Jewish unity.

We once mentioned (see Sicha of Purim, 5747) that according to the signs given in the Gemara, we are right before the revelation of Moshiach, and therefore the words of Daniel (12:10) apply: "Many things will be clarified, refined and purified." Included in this is that many negative traits which were previously concealed will come out into the open. The reason this is necessary is because everything must be purified before Moshiach's coming. And unless it is revealed, its purification is impossible.

In our times, the concern about d'chikas haketz (pushing the end) does not apply. According to the Gemara, "All the deadlines have past" (kalu kol ha'kitzin), including the regular time (b'itah) -- in fact the first b'itah, the second b'itah, the third b'itah, etc. Therefore, there is no worry about d'chikas haketz, and certainly no sparks will be left behind.

May it be G-d's will that there be the fulfillment of the verse from the portion of the 12th of Tammuz (Num. 23:21), "G-d does not look at wrongdoing in Ya'akov, and He sees no vice in Yisrael." This means that in spite of the existence of what the Torah itself calls "wrongdoing" and "vice," G-d nevertheless pays no attention to it.

Furthermore, it should reach the state described in the portion of the 13th of Tammuz (Num. 24:5), "How goodly are your tents, O Ya'akov, your dwelling places, O Yisrael!" Even a non-Jew, and even someone as wicked as Bilaam can see only good among the Jews, since there is no longer any strife or disagreement.

The lesson from this for every Jew is that we should fulfill the mitzvah of "cleaving to G-d," by imitating His ways as well as we can. In this case, we should not see "wrongdoing" or "vice" in another Jew; and if it seems to be there, it is either a mistake, or that the other person is acting as a "mirror," reflecting the fault that is really present in the observer.

Since the beginning of the month, we have spoken many times about making chassidic gatherings during Tammuz. This request made a bit of an impression, but not to the extent that it should have. And although, "There's no point in complaining about the past," it's well known that the Previous Rebbe said, "It's never too late" (nitoh kein farfallen). Therefore, the next few days should be used out for such gatherings.

It should be pointed out that the 15th of Tammuz is also the yartzeit of the Or HaChaim HaKadosh. There is a well-known account from reliable sources that if the Or HaChaim had actually met the Baal Shem Tov, that Moshiach would have come at that time.

There should be great joy at these gatherings, but one should not violate the Previous Rebbe's prohibition against becoming intoxicated. The joy should come from simchah shel mitzvah ("joy of the mitzvah") -- in particular from learning Torah, which "gladdens the heart." And if one insists on drinking wine beyond all limitations, he should learn extra Chassidus, which is called the "wine" of Torah, and throw himself into it without any limitations.

May it be G-d's will that from these niggunim we go singing and dancing to the Tenth Song, which will be with the coming of Moshiach. It is alluded to in the Song which was sung when the Jewish people crossed the Sea, Az Yashir. Our Sages point out that the word Yashir is in future tense, referring to the Tenth Song of the Messianic Age. May we see this immediately with the coming of Moshiach.
