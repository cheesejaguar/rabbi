# The Month of Light

**Occasion:** Kislev
**Source:** Days of Destiny, Sichos In English

---

The month of Kislev centers on one concept: "the illumination of darkness." Both Chanukah and the nineteenth day of Kislev (the festival of liberation of the Alter Rebbe) celebrate occasions when spiritual darkness transformed into G-dliness's light.

## Connection to Torah's Third Month

Kislev functions as the third month when counting from Tishrei. Just as Sivan (the third month from Nissan) witnessed the revealed Torah's giving at Mt. Sinai, Kislev marks when the hidden aspects of Torah — specifically Chassidus — became principally revealed. The Alter Rebbe systematized Chassidic teachings "as a logical, orderly system, comprehensible to all" beginning after the nineteenth of Kislev.

## Chanukah as Compensation

A Midrash explains that Kislev "missed out" on hosting the Sanctuary's dedication (which occurred in Nissan), so G-d compensated through the Chasmoneans' rededication after Greek desecration. This third dedication (following the Sanctuary and First Temple) connects to the third month.

## Darkness Preceding Light

Significantly, both revelations followed darkness: the Greeks' spiritual defilement preceded Chanukah's lights, and intensifying exile preceded Chassidus's emergence. This pattern teaches that "the resulting light is that much greater" when it dispels preceding darkness.

## Practical Directive

Rather than despair over exile's murkiness, Jews should recognize that converting darkness into light itself becomes transformative work. As exile darkens, sufficient G-dliness's revelation hastens redemption's arrival.
