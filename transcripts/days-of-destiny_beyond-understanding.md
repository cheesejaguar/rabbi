# Beyond Understanding

The parah adumah (red heifer) exemplifies a mitzvah (commandment) that transcends human logic. As the text explains, "The parah adumah is the example par excellence of a mitzvah which is beyond all human comprehension and which is fulfilled out of pure acceptance of G-d's will."

## Classification of Commandments

The text categorizes Torah's mitzvos into three types:

**Mishpatim** -- commandments aligned with rational thought, like prohibitions against theft and murder.

**Eidus** -- commandments understandable once commanded, such as festival observances that commemorate historical events.

**Chukim** -- statutes defying human comprehension, fulfilled solely through divine obedience.

## The Red Heifer's Paradox

The red heifer uniquely exemplifies the chok category. Even King Solomon, history's wisest figure, couldn't grasp its logic. The ritual purified the impure while simultaneously rendering the pure impure -- a logical contradiction.

## A Unified Principle

The chapter emphasizes that all mitzvos, regardless of category, share an essential nature: they originate from divine will transcending human understanding. The Torah states this principle through the parah adumah, teaching that complete acceptance of G-d's commands must underlie every observance, whether logically comprehensible or mysteriously obscure.
