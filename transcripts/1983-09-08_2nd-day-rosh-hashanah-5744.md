1. The discourse discusses the custom of mentioning names of Chassidic leaders on Rosh Hashanah, including the Baal Shem Tov, various Rebbeim, and the AriZal. The connection to redemption is explained through the AriZal's name (Yitzchok) and its association with future redemption. The merit of these spiritual fathers is invoked similarly to how the daily Temple sacrifice mentioned Chevron, where the patriarchs are buried. The word "Chevron" derives from "chibur" (connection), representing the bond between the fathers and G-d. The practice involves singing melodies associated with these leaders rather than merely stating their names.

2. Following the meal blessing, the Rebbe addresses whether specific variations of prayers should be used during the Ten Days of Repentance and whether particular petitions about future redemption should be recited in specific circumstances.
