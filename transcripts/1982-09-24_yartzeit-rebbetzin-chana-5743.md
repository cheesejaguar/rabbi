Despite differences among Jews in background, opinion, and service style, they remain "one nation" bound by a shared divine soul and "one Torah" from "one G-d."

Unity at the soul level must manifest practically through "love your fellow as yourself." The Rebbe uses the metaphor of blood flowing through a body's limbs to illustrate how unity must actively sustain all individuals.

The approaching Day of Atonement represents the year's peak emphasis on unity, described as "one in soul" (High Priest), "one in year" (unique day), and "one in world" (Holy of Holies).

Deceased souls, including Rebbetzin Chana, exemplify perfect unity in the spiritual realm. Their connection to the living inspires greater cohesion.

Jewish unity influences world peace and gentile observance of the Noachide Laws. This mission should be undertaken with "joy and delight" rather than burden.

Drawing on the principle that Rosh Hashanah fell on Shabbos (associated with delight), the Rebbe advocates approaching divine service as pleasurable rather than burdensome.
