The talk addresses a contrast in chassidic participation during Pesach observances. The Rebbe notes that previously, when access was restricted, chassidim eagerly gathered and competed for positions. However, with doors now open, attendance has declined.

The Rebbe observes that while some chassidim completed their own Seders and visited, they failed to bring their Afikoman to continue the Seder in the Previous Rebbe's room -- the location where he conducted Sedarim for ten years.

The text emphasizes that "there were those who after having completed their own Seder came to see what was going on, but none of them brought their Afikoman with them so that they could eat it in the room in which the Rebbe [Rayatz] used to conduct his Sedarim."

The discourse includes a discussion of Eliyahu HaNavi's presence, explaining that while he can appear in multiple places simultaneously through sparks, his personal presence is limited to one location.

The Rebbe draws a parallel to Rabbeinu HaKadosh, who continued visiting his home on Shabbat and festival eves after his passing to recite Kiddush.

On the second day of Pesach, when many chassidim and Tomchei Temimim students arrived, the Rebbe directed that those requiring Afikoman be served soup from the Previous Rebbe's historic silver bowl.
