## Section 1: Connections Between Lag B'Omer, Shabbos Mevarchim, and Sivan

The teaching explores how "the end is implanted in the beginning" through Torah's unifying role. It examines three distinct terms for Mt. Sinai -- Mt. Sinai, Sinai, and "the mountain" -- each representing different spiritual levels. The sicho emphasizes that "deed is most essential," urging listeners to fulfill resolutions from Lag B'Omer and implement new commitments for Sivan, particularly regarding correction and outreach.

## Section 2: The Portion Behar -- Mountain Symbolism

This section analyzes "Behar" (the mountain) as representing Mt. Sinai and discusses the balance between humility and appropriate pride. The teaching explains that while humility is necessary generally, there are times when Jewish identity requires strength, particularly when Torah and mitzvos face challenges.

## Section 3: The Portion Bechukosai -- Super-Rational Commandments

The discourse addresses three categories of commandments: Eidos (testimonies), Mishpotim (judgments), and Chukkim (statutes). It clarifies that fulfilling Chukkim transcends intellectual understanding, requiring commitment to G-d's will beyond rational comprehension or desire for reward.

## Section 4: The Combined Portions

When Behar and Bechukosai merge into one portion, they teach complementary services: pride in Torah study and self-nullification in prayer. The teaching notes these usually separate portions can unite, similar to how fear and love of G-d, while distinct, both characterize Jewish service.

## Section 5: Terminology and Outreach Concerns

The sicho addresses the expression "Kiruv Richokim" (drawing the far close), arguing this terminology is improper. The teaching emphasizes no Jew is truly distant from Yiddishkeit, requiring respectful, non-condescending outreach reflecting genuine love for all Jews.

## Section 6: Divine Presence in Exile

This section interprets the Zohar's teaching on "the market of tanners," explaining how G-d's presence accompanies Jews even in difficult circumstances, illustrating divine love for Israel.

## Section 7: Fast Announcement

The final major section announces the Rebbe's participation in a half-day communal fast on Erev Rosh Chodesh Sivan. The teaching explains that communal efforts -- combining fasting, prayer, tzedakah, and Torah study -- create unified spiritual power to address global challenges. Specific Psalms (1, 20, 22, 35, 38, 69, 79, 83, 87, 130, 142, 150) are designated for recitation during the fast.
