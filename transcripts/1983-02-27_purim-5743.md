1. We have been taught: "Open with a Blessing," i.e. whenever Jews meet together, or hold a Farbrengen, they should begin their statements with blessings; as the verse declares "Blessed are those who come in the name of the L-rd." The above is particularly true if the farbrengen is held on an auspicious day, such as the holiday of Purim and in an auspicious place -- a synagogue or a house of study. The influences of the prayer and study carried out there will surely add to the nature of those blessings, bringing them to a most complete state.

In its fullest sense, the concept of blessing involves blessing in both spiritual and material matters. Though the essential being of a Jew is connected with the spiritual -- for behold, we are created "in His (G-d's) form and image." Nevertheless, the soul descended and enclothed itself in a physical body. Furthermore, we find that the Torah was given to us as we are, souls in bodies, and hence, for a blessing to be complete it must encompass the totality of a Jew's being, affecting both his spiritual and physical aspects.

Furthermore, a complete blessing is one that is unlimited in the sphere of time, and effects the days which follow. This is surely relevant regarding the holiday of Purim, a festival whose celebration should influence the entire year to come.

One of the unique aspects of the Purim narrative is the firm stance of the Jewish people as "Mordechai's nation." Just as Mordechai "would neither bend the knee or bow down," similarly, his example was followed by the entire nation. Though the Jews were in exile, "scattered abroad and dispersed among the nations," they acted as "one nation" and emphasized their oneness by not "bending or bowing."

From another perspective, Purim emphasizes the concept of happiness to an even greater degree than the pilgrimage festivals. Though those holidays are referred to as "festivals for rejoicing," it was customary for the Rabbinic court to send agents to insure that the rejoicing was held within bounds. In contrast, the rejoicing of Purim is unlimited, as our Sages declared, "on Purim, a person is obligated to drink to the point where he does not know the difference between 'Cursed be Haman' and 'Blessed be Mordechai.'"

Thus, Purim emphasizes the service of G-d, acceptance of the "yoke of Heaven" with joy. Since "joy breaks down all barriers," this joy will allow unlimited success in all aspects of the service of G-d and particularly in regard to Tzedakah.

2. The very format of a farbrengen arouses a question: Why should hundreds of Jews including many who themselves are wise and understanding, assemble year after year to hear Torah from one individual?

The answer can be understood on the basis of the following concept: A Nasi -- leader of the Jewish people -- must care for both the spiritual and material needs of the people. Moshe, our teacher, the first leader of the Jewish people provides a paradigm of this behavior. He gave the Jews the Torah, i.e. dealt with their spiritual needs, but also it was in his merit that the manna descended, i.e. he also tended to their material necessities.

This is answered in light of a story of the Alter Rebbe. Once during the first year as a Rebbe, a particularly large crowd of Chassidim came to celebrate a holiday together with the Alter Rebbe. When the Alter Rebbe saw the large crowd assembling, he sought to hide. Realizing the nature of the situation, his wife approached him and asked him to explain his behavior. He told her, "Why are they coming to me and asking me to teach them Torah?" She answered him: "They are merely coming to hear from you what you had the privilege of hearing from your teacher." "If so," answered the Alter Rebbe, "I will tell them more and more" and opened his window and began to recite Chassidus.

Not everyone in the community is able to give up his own pursuits, his own spiritual as well as material pursuits, in order to study Torah, "sacred texts," and listen to other "scholars," wading through the vast sea of Torah until he can find subjects that are appropriate for the community at large and present them in an easily accessible form. Hence, only one individual is chosen for that task.

Thus, we can see the unique quality of a farbrengen. When many Jews join together to encourage each other in the service of G-d, each individual's task is made easier. Our Sages explained that two people working together can carry a greater burden than the combined sum of their individual efforts.

3. One of the concepts mentioned in the very beginning of the Megillah is that all those who attended the feasts of Achashverosh were served "according to every man's pleasure." Furthermore, the Talmud explains that the phrase "every man" includes Haman and Mordechai -- i.e. the two opposite ends of the spectrum and thus, all those who fall between these two extremes.

From the above, we can learn a lesson regarding the manner in which any government should relate to its subjects. In order that every subject in a country can live normally, it is necessary for him to be given freedom to live according to his own desires. What a subject wants is not to be told that he is being given the ultimate good by the government, but rather, to have the ability to choose what he feels is good without anybody forcing him to do anything against his will.

The concept brings up a very painful subject, the situation of our Jewish brethren in Russia who are being forced to remain behind the Iron Curtain against their will. Without questioning whether that country's economic policies are correct or not, there is no question that its citizens should not be denied a minimality of human rights as guaranteed by that country's constitution and the U.N. charter which that country signed.

Indeed, from a certain perspective, life behind the Iron Curtain can be compared to life in prison. On the surface, there is an advantage to life in a prison over normal civilian life. In a prison, an inmate is given room and board free, whatever medical attention he requires, educational opportunities, etc. Nevertheless, any normal person will desire to live independently rather than in prison. Indeed, according to Jewish law, one must offer a special blessing of thanks after being released from prison. Why? Because a prisoner is no longer in control over his own existence.

Our Sages taught, "deed is most essential": The knowledge of the situation of our brethren behind the Iron Curtain should motivate us all to do all that is possible to rectify the situation. A word of caution: No openhanded criticism should be leveled at the Russian government. On the contrary, such criticism will only cause them to stiffen their stance. Rather, the point should be made that since they pride themselves as being champions of freedom and human rights, it is only fitting that the right to decide on one's place of residence be granted to their citizens.

In order to effect a change within the context of the natural order in regard to the situation of our brethren in Russia, first we must take a step above the natural order. By devoting our energies to the spiritual needs facing our people at present, we will be able to arouse G-d's blessing and thus, bring about success in all matters.

We can learn a lesson concerning the direction in which we should channel our efforts from the Purim narrative. Our Sages explain that after Haman's decree was pronounced, Mordechai gathered together thousands of Jewish children. It was the voices of the young children and their words of Torah and prayer that brought about the nullification of Haman's decree.

Similarly, in our time, our efforts must be centered on Mivtzah Chinuch -- the Education Campaign -- and in particular to educate Jewish children who are below Bar and Bas Mitzvah ages and to teach them that they are "Mordechai's nation." Thus, their natural response will be not to bow down or bend.

Though it is true that much positive effort has been made in the field of Jewish education, there are still many Jewish children wandering like lost sheep in a desert. We cannot content ourselves with working to insure that those children already enrolled in Jewish schools receive a proper education, but rather efforts must be made to reach out to those children who at present are not receiving any Torah education.

4. In the Purim narrative, a central role was played by Queen Esther. Indeed, her efforts were the ones that actually brought about the nullification of Haman's decree and therefore, the Megillah is called Megillas Esther. Similarly, a major role in the education of Jewish children is played by Jewish women.

The Megillah states, "the statements of Mordechai, Esther carried out," i.e. Esther put into practice the statements of Mordechai, the nation's Torah leader. As soon as his will became known to her, she did not question or debate with Mordechai -- she immediately put it into practice. She knew that the responsibility for the nullification of the decree on the level of deed and action was hers. Similarly, Jewish women today have the responsibility of caring for the Torah education of their children.

The woman's influence extends beyond her children and she also has the power to motivate her husband. The commentaries have explained this point in their interpretation of our Sages' statement: "Who is the proper wife -- one who carries out her husband's will." They noted that the Hebrew word for carry out -- Oseh -- can also be translated as to make or create. Hence, our Sages' statement can also be read as, "Who is the proper wife -- one who creates her husband's will."

Our Sages taught: "Through the merit of the righteous women, our ancestors were released from Egypt." Thus, we see that a woman's behavior can have a further and greater effect -- the redemption of our people. The major activity of the women of that age was, as our Sages taught, bearing and raising Jewish children. Despite the decrees of Pharaoh, the women gave birth to a new generation of Jewish children. Similarly, in the present age, the task of the Jewish women is to give birth to and raise a generation of Tzivos Hashem -- G-d's army, a host of Jewish children who will march with joy and happiness to greet Moshiach, speedily in our days.
