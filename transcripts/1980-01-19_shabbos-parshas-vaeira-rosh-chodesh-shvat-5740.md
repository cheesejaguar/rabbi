## Section 1

Today marks Rosh Chodesh Shvat, commemorated in Deuteronomy where "Moshe began to explain the Torah." This date also recalls the Yahrzeit of the Previous Rebbe on the tenth of Shvat. The Rosh (head) of the month encompasses all subsequent days.

Including Yud Shvat within Rosh Chodesh represents a relatively recent innovation, creating an apparent paradox: Torah embodies both constancy and innovation. Since "He and His wisdom are one" and "I, G-d, have not changed," how can innovation exist in Torah study and observance?

Yet the Zohar teaches that each person must develop new Torah ideas. The Alter Rebbe explains in Hilchos Talmud Torah that Jews must continually discover and apply fresh Torah concepts appropriate to their abilities -- failure to do so neglects this obligation.

Innovation characterizes physical creation itself. Daily prayers praise G-d for "renewing each day...the work of creation." Since the world was created for Torah's sake (as stated in the Zohar: "G-d looked into Torah and created the world"), spiritual innovation should parallel physical creativity.

This paradox resolves at G-d's essence level, transcending both change and consistency. This divine source enables Jews to develop novel Torah concepts, channeling innovation into the world through Torah's power.

Each generation reveals fresh Torah aspects. Torah, though "His delight" and "hidden from all living things," became enclothed within creation -- itself an innovation. Subsequently, each generation uncovered new dimensions. The principle "every concept authored by an experienced student was given to Moshe on Mt. Sinai" applies even now.

Regarding Rosh Chodesh Shvat: previously, the first of Shvat connected solely to Moshe's Torah explanation. Our generation introduced another element -- the Previous Rebbe's Yahrzeit. On a Tzaddik's Yahrzeit, "all the service of the man for which his soul labored...becomes revealed and shines...causing salvation in the depths of the world."

These aspects interrelate: Rashi notes that Moshe explained Torah in seventy languages, addressing its revealed aspects (Nigleh). The Previous Rebbe contributed further by explaining Torah's inner dimensions -- Chassidic teachings -- in seventy languages, "spreading the wellsprings of Chassidus outward," enabling individual understanding within each person's framework.

Moshe's translation corresponded to languages' connection with the Jewish people. The Previous Rebbe's translation addressed languages as distinct entities, separate from Jewish peoplehood.

Why did Moshe require translation? Though the entire Jewish people knew Hebrew, spoke one language, lived together, and possessed higher spiritual standing ("there was not one of them who had a heavenly decree against them"), all seventy languages and nations originate within the Jewish people and language. Torah contains non-Hebrew phrases like "Yegarsahadutha" (Genesis 31:47). Similarly, Jacob's seventy children source the seventy world nations. Moshe translated Torah at the level corresponding to these nations' source. The Previous Rebbe translated Chassidus addressing non-Jews' comprehension level, exemplifying "spreading the wellsprings of Chassidus outward" -- rendering Chassidic mystical secrets accessible in seventy world languages.

Various service levels characterize "spreading the wellsprings of Chassidus outward." This generally began with the Baal Shem Tov, more particularly with the Alter Rebbe, especially following his prison release. Another stage commenced under the Rebbe Rashab. The Previous Rebbe's generation -- the seventh, of which "all sevenths are dear" -- initiated a new phase where wellsprings reached those temporarily disconnected from Jewish life, comprehensible within their linguistic and contextual understanding.

This provides practical instruction: beginning Rosh Chodesh Shvat, we intensify efforts spreading not merely revealed Torah but "the wellsprings of Chassidus outward." We must reach Jews currently separated from their heritage, immersing them in these wellsprings, addressing them in their language and understanding.

Thus we prepare for Messianic redemption. This generation collects all previous generations' righteous deeds, creating treasured accumulation. We merit fulfilling the prophecy: "As in the days of your exodus from Egypt I will show you wonders," through Mashiach's arrival.

## Section 2

The Previous Rebbe's innovation -- translating Chabad Chassidic teachings into seventy languages -- provoked critics questioning how Torah's deepest secrets should be publicly disseminated through newspapers and popular media.

This refutation parallels the Talmud's account (Megillah 9a, Sofrim 1:8) regarding Torah's Greek translation. The Talmud relates: "King Ptolemy brought together seventy-two elders...in seventy-two separate rooms...he ordered 'Translate the Torah for me'...G-d prompted each one and they all conceived the same idea." Sofrim (1:7-8) explains: "the day of the translation was as grievous for Israel as the day on which the golden calf was made, since the Torah could not be accurately translated."

This expression appears elsewhere. Shabbos 17a describes Bais Shammai's students outnumbering Bais Hillel when discussing Torah law. "On that day Hillel sat submissive before Shammai, like one of the disciples, and it was grievous to Israel as the day the golden calf was made."

The phrase "as grievous to Israel" doesn't represent total condemnation. Shammai was a great sage receiving teachings from Shemayah and Avtalyon alongside Hillel. Hillel's students mentioned Shammai's opinions before their own (Eruvin 13b). Such stature precludes purely negative intent.

Rashi explains that day's grievousness stemmed from Hillel's submission -- he being a Nasi and humble person. This interpretation prevents construing the golden calf comparison as absolute condemnation. King David and King Yehoshafat honored Torah despite their high positions. Similarly, despite humility, Hillel wouldn't have submitted if it diminished Torah's honor. Thus Hillel's submission lacks the golden calf's negative connotation.

Precise Talmudic interpretation is essential. The golden calf's making day itself wasn't calamitous. Made on the sixteenth of Tammuz, Aaron declared: "Tomorrow will be a festival unto G-d" (Exodus 32:5). He hoped the people would repent or Moshe would return (Rashi notes), and indeed the next day could be a G-d festival.

Therefore, "the golden calf's making day" differs entirely from its worship day. Initially, it wasn't certain the calf would become an idol. The source prompting the people's request was legitimate -- thinking Moshe had perished, they sought an intermediary like him maintaining G-d connection. (Deuteronomy 5:24 mentions this need: the people asked Moshe "go near, and hear all that the L-rd our G-d shall say; and speak to us...and we will hear and do it." G-d approved: "all that they have spoken was well said.") Moshe had filled this role; his absence prompted seeking a replacement.

Despite these positive possibilities, the golden calf's making day represented a difficult challenge. When the Jews failed overcoming it, grievous sin resulted.

Understanding this clarifies comparing the Torah's Greek translation to "the golden calf's making day." The Talmud explains that complete Torah translation is impossible, representing a challenge. Translation risked misunderstanding and eventually denying G-d's Oneness. For instance, "Bereishis Borah Elokim" (Genesis 1:1) could translate as "In the beginning created G-d," potentially suggesting something preceded G-d's creation. Therefore, the sages translated for Ptolemy as "G-d created in the beginning," eliminating ambiguity.

Like the golden calf day, Torah translation presented two possibilities. Without amendment, denying G-d's Oneness could have resulted. However, the seventy-two sages received "Divine inspiration" and composed a translation precluding such possibility. While Aaron couldn't motivate overcoming the golden calf challenge, the sages succeeded with G-d's help.

A similar interpretation explains why "the day Hillel sat submissive before Shammai was as grievous to Israel as the golden calf's making day."

Hillel and Aaron employed similar approaches. Aaron was "a man of kindness," who "loved peace and pursued peace, loved the creations and brought them close to Torah." He regarded everyone kindly. Even witnessing the golden calf, he believed it would bring "a festival unto G-d." Similarly, Hillel's humility motivated descending to everyone's level, viewing each individual, regardless of stature, kindly. What inspired Hillel? He recognized that every Jewish soul had "descended from a high peak to a deep pit," necessitating bringing kindness to everyone's level. He followed "educate the child according to his way" -- appropriate to his perspective.

Shammai operated from truth's perspective, adopting severe opinions without adapting to individuals' contexts, instead forcing perspective changes toward truth. This approach couldn't maintain the world.

This contrast corresponds with the Alter Rebbe's "Nefesh Hashfelah" text, quoting a Midrash: "truth said do not create (the world), kindness said create," explaining that even false kindness is necessary maintaining the world.

Following this principle, behavior should emulate Hillel. But what if Torah's wisdom suggests following Shammai? Rashi explains Hillel possessed two advantages: he was humble, following Aaron's approach, descending to each person's level, perceiving that even today's golden calf could mean "tomorrow" brings a G-d festival. Additionally, he was Nasi with halachic authority. Creation's order required his approach maintaining the world.

"The day Hillel sat submissive before Shammai was as grievous to Israel as the golden calf's making day" because it risked subsequent days following similarly, establishing halachah unsustainably. Halachah must follow kindness's attribute (shown by Aaron and Hillel), yet that day reflected opposite qualities. That day paralleled "the golden calf's making day." A challenge to proper halachic approach occurred. However, this challenge was overcome -- subsequent days restored halachic power to Hillel.

Aaron's kindness approach affected the world. Absent sin, the next day would have been "a festival for G-d." Aaron's approach postponed sin one day, allowing the Jewish people completing forty full days of G-d's "good will" (Rashi Exodus 33:11). It influenced Moshe, whose truth-approach resembled Shammai's, to change course and request G-d's forgiveness.

This explains why Chassidim wept hearing Messianic coming depends on "spreading the wellsprings of Chassidus" outward -- representing tremendous challenge, thus tears. Yet through this service, "a holiday for G-d" emerged. It succeeded, increasing holiness. Similarly, the Previous Rebbe's "seventy languages" translation represented severe challenge, succeeding and creating "a holiday for G-d."

This demands practical application: we must "spread the wellsprings of Chassidus outward." We must view every Jew -- even heritage-estranged ones -- as Aaron viewed the Jews during the golden calf's making. This service brings Mashiach, redeeming us and "leading us upright to our land" soon.

## Section 3

The Rebbe mentioned the Chassidic custom of studying weekly Maamarim in Torah Or and Likkutei Torah under the weekly portion heading. The Rebbe emphasized this custom's importance, advising learning as much "Chassidishe parshah" (Torah Or and Likkutei Torah) as possible weekly, with at least several lines studied deeply.
