## Extended Celebration

The Rebbe explains that in Jewish practice, holy occasions extend beyond their primary date. He notes that "in holy matters, the night follows the day," distinguishing this from mundane matters where night precedes day.

## The AriZal's Custom

The sicho references the Kabbalist known as the AriZal, who would journey to Meron to celebrate Lag B'Omer for three days. Following this precedent, three farbrengens (gatherings) were held in connection with the holiday.

## R. Shimon's Teachings

The discourse emphasizes Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai's approach to Torah and service. A notable teaching is presented: "I can free the entire world from judgment," reflecting his love for all Israel.

## Torah and Love Combined

The sicho illustrates how R. Shimon balanced scholarly devotion with deep concern for others, citing a Talmudic account where sages engaged in rigorous debate ("wars of Torah") yet parted "with kisses."

## Contemporary Application

The teaching connects these ancient principles to modern Jewish education, addressing parents' concerns about their children's material welfare while studying Torah.
