# How to Serve G-d

**Occasion:** 18th of Elul

The eighteenth of Elul commemorates the birthdays of two major Jewish spiritual leaders: the Baal Shem Tov, who founded Chassidus generally, and the Alter Rebbe, who established Chabad Chassidus specifically.

## Key Distinction

The Previous Rebbe explained a crucial difference between these two figures. The Baal Shem Tov demonstrated "how we should serve G-d," while the Alter Rebbe showed "how we can serve G-d." This distinction emphasizes divine obligation versus human capability.

## Intellectual Framework

Chabad introduced an important innovation by presenting Chassidic concepts within an intellectual structure. Rather than relying solely on faith, this approach enables individuals to comprehend spiritual teachings through their own wisdom, understanding, and knowledge.

## The Torah Analogy

The text compares this development to how Torah itself functions. Moses received the foundational rules for deriving new concepts, not every detailed law. Future scholars use these principles to derive novel interpretations that are simultaneously "new" (to the individual) and encompassed in the original revelation.

## Practical Impact

By making Chassidic doctrines intellectually accessible, the Alter Rebbe enabled each person to internalize spiritual vitality through personal effort rather than passive reception. This approach allows individual soul-powers to develop according to their unique characteristics, infusing authentic life into religious observance.
