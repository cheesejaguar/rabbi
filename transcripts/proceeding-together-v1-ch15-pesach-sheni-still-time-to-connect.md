## 1. The 14th and 15th of Iyar

The present farbrengen, occurring after Maariv on the fifteenth of Iyar, remains connected to Pesach Sheni on the fourteenth. The sacrifice timing parallels the first Pesach -- offered on the fourteenth, eaten on the eve of the fifteenth.

## 2. A Misprint with a Message

In the Counting of the Omer, Pesach Sheni's characteristic Sefirah is Chessed shebeHod. The Rebbe Rayatz's Siddur mistakenly printed "Hod shebeChessed," which he corrected to "Chessed shebeHod."

The Baal Shem Tov taught that everything occurring results from Divine Providence and contains lessons for G-d's service.

## 3. Pesach Sheni in the Sefiros

When close to Pesach, when Chessed is revealed, even Hod shebeChessed suffices, making that day merely Chol HaMoed. However, as time distances from the revelation and approaches obscurity, the underlying Chessed within Hod must be revealed -- that the ultimate intent underlying obscurity is revelation expressed through Chessed. This divinely-intended revelation is so sublime that the day becomes Yom-Tov.

## 4. A Cosmic Correction

The Siddur's omission by Divine Providence indicates that thickening galus gloom created a kitrug -- a prosecuting voice in Heaven. The Rebbe Rayatz, as the Jewish people's Nasi at galus's end, rectified this by writing "Chessed shebeHod" in his Siddur.

## 5. A Bond of Unfailing Love

Despite concealment that the Rebbe's histalkus entails, the bond with those privileged to see the Rebbe endures with undiminished intensity.

The Rebbe Rayatz once taught: "Chassidus brought about a situation where the Rebbe is not solitary, and chassidim are not solitary," meaning the Rebbe watches over and cares about every chassid's life details. Now, on a higher plane, he continues this care.

## 6. A Slap in the Nation's Face

One renowned thinker asked: "If Creation's ultimate intent is the Jewish people, how can G-d allow that execrable villain to burn great numbers of Jews?"

The Rebbe replied: "When one wants to strike a man so his whole body feels pain and indignity, one slaps him in the face...."

## 7. Never Too Late

The Rebbe Rayatz taught that Pesach Sheni's message is "there is no such thing as too late." One can always rectify. Even if impure, or "on a distant road of yours" -- at distance of one's choosing -- rectification remains possible.

Some never were in the Rebbe's presence. Others technically saw him many times, yet since this affected them nothing, they never truly were present.

Pesach Sheni's message reminds us: Even one who failed offering the first Pesach sacrifice can correct the past through Second Pesach.

## 8. Recalling a Face: Recalled by a Face

One method involves picturing the Rebbe's countenance. Whoever visited the Rebbe at yechidus should recall his appearance. Those who never saw him should visualize his face through a picture.

Visualizing the Rebbe's face means beholding him in a sense. "In a certain way this is superior to studying his teachings, just as seeing is superior to hearing."

## 9. Forty Years of Hindsight

The Sages teach: "No man plumbs the profundity of his mentor's understanding until forty years have elapsed." Though spiritually unresponsive to the Rebbe's presence previously, a person may now -- through a picture enabling seeing the Rebbe mentally -- attain appropriate sensitivity.

## 10. Self-Sacrifice at No Cost

According to one opinion, "those people... had been occupied in the burial of a mes mitzvah." For "any Jew... found lying by the roadside with no one to bury him," law prescribes that "[even] a Kohen... is obliged to defile himself by contact with him... and to bury him."

Similar obligation applies spiritually: Encountering a fellow Jew spiritually dead requires getting involved. One must actively encourage basic matters like tefillin and Shabbos observance, even if one's own divine service suffers.

## 11. Carrying the Ark of Yosef

Speaking of "Yosef's ark" -- the Rebbe Yosef Yitzchak's directives and instructions -- the task is carrying this ark forward, regardless of obstacles. Even when it seems we should conduct ourselves otherwise for holy reasons, such considerations don't concern us: our task is carrying Yosef's ark forward.

## 12. Mitzvos and Takkanos

The Rebbe Rayatz's directives resemble ordinances (takkanos) Moshe Rabbeinu ordained for Jews. Takkanos, whose authority roots in Sages' words, derive from and depend upon sources in the world below, with purpose correcting and perfecting the world below.

A major avodah principle requires mitzvah fulfillment not metaphysically but in its natural garb -- for refining and uplifting this world's materiality below.

A certain chassid entered the Rebbe Rayatz's study seeking advice. Responding to the Rebbe's advice, he argued he'd find the proposed course difficult; he'd prefer easier advice. The Rebbe Rayatz responded: "Why resort to fancy exploits when one can manage without? Indeed, Chassidus teaches us that one's avodah should be done specifically within nature's parameters."

This applies also to takkanos instituted by the Rebbe Rayatz; for example, the takkanah instituting daily study cycles known by acronym Chitas -- Chumash-with-Rashi, Tehillim and Tanya.
