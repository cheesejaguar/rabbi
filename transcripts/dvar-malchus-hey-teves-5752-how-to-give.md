The Kuntres printed for Hey Teves in 5752 is a Chassidic Discourse the Rebbe said on parshas Vayigash, 5732, edited for publication under the Rebbe's supervision.

## Context

The parsha begins with Yehuda approaching Yosef. Yosef was dressed as an Egyptian; his brothers didn't recognize him. This "Egyptian" demanded their brother Binyomin remain as a slave due to a goblet "theft" Yosef orchestrated. Yehuda fearlessly approaches and requests -- even demands -- that the "Egyptian" release Binyomin to return to his father and enslave another brother instead.

## Inner Meaning

Yehuda's selflessness rectifies the original sale of Yosef. According to Chassidus, deeper concepts occur here: Yosef represents Z"A and Yesod (the mashpia who gives spiritual influence); Yehuda represents Malchus (the mekabel who receives). Yehuda requests receiving this spiritual influence, reflecting active participation of the mekabel.

The mashpia is higher than the mekabel. However, in their source, this reverses: the mekabel's source exists at Kesser (the "crown"), far above the mashpia's source.

When the mashpia gives to the mekabel (who has higher Kesser source), the mashpia also receives this Kesser level. By giving, the mashpia receives something greater from the mekabel.

## The Rebbe's Explanation

The Rebbe explains Yehuda's words "bi adoni" (usually "please, my lord"), noting "bi" means "in me." The Rebbe explains: "This that Z"A wants to give over to Malchus (because any bestowal of spiritual influence is only through a desire for such) is because it feels the lofty level of the source of Malchus, which is mainly that by giving over to Malchus the result will be the perfection of that which is drawn down into Z"A. Thus, Yehuda said to Yosef 'in me, my lord' -- that the spiritual influence drawn down from Z"A to Malchus should be (not for the perfection of Z"A, but rather) in order that this spiritual influence should be drawn down to Malchus, 'in me, my lord.'"

## Levels of Giving

One who can give/teach others may consider how this perfects themselves -- and correctly so. "Helping others is good for you." Yet a loftier level exists when done without self-consideration, only for the receiver's benefit and sake.

## Connection to Geuloh

After this, Yosef revealed himself to his brothers, modeling Hashem's revelation to us in the true and complete Geuloh.
