1. The joy increases each night of Sukkos, and the third night establishes a "chazakah" (established fact) that strengthens all previous nights. The discourse references Hosheah 6:2 regarding the third Bais Hamikdosh and draws parallels to the permanence of the Sanctuary concept.

2. The 3rd night is associated with the guests Ya'akov and the Alter Rebbe, both emphasizing Torah study. "Ya'akov was a plain man, dwelling in tents" -- referencing the tents of Shem and Ever -- and the Alter Rebbe's emphasis on halachic instruction through the Shulchan Aruch are highlighted. The Torah reading from parshas Berachah concerning Levi's tribe and the Bais Hamikdosh in Binyamin's portion receive detailed analysis.

3. The discourse addresses spreading joy to others and to the nations, citing the principle that "it was good" appears twice on creation's third day. The 70 bullocks offered during Sukkos correspond to the 70 nations, establishing their dependence on Jewish service. The discourse warns against losing the "pride of Ya'akov" when dealing with non-Jews and emphasizes maintaining proper conduct according to Jewish law. References to Ya'akov's twenty years in Lavan's house and the 15 Songs of Ascent from Psalms connect Ya'akov to Simchas Bais Hashoevah, where Levites sang these songs on 15 steps.
