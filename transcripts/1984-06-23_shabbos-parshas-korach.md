1. The Shabbos on which a month is blessed (Shabbos Mevarchim) is always situated in the preceding month. Accordingly, the Shabbos which blesses the fourth month (Tammuz) is in the third month (Sivan). That the fourth month is blessed by [a Shabbos in] the third month indicates a connection between the two months.

But is there necessarily a connection? Shabbos Mevarchim, because it blesses the coming month, must be before Rosh Chodesh of the coming month -- i.e., it must be in the preceding month. In the order of the months, the third month naturally precedes the fourth. Hence the Shabbos which blesses the fourth month must be in the third month. Why, then, must we conclude that there is a connection between them?

However, the Rogatchover writes that "Everything, although seemingly having to be, was all directed and commanded by G-d." Thus, when two things in Torah are joined, there is a connection between them although they seemingly had to be joined. For Torah is master of the universe, and Torah cannot be limited in any way. Although we cannot grasp how it can exist in any other way, we believe with simple faith that it is so. Since these two things are joined -- although they didn't have to be -- there is a connection between them.

In our case, although it seems the blessing for the fourth month must stem from the third month, it did not necessarily have to be from Torah's perspective. The fact that it is indicates a connection between the two months.

To understand the lesson for service to G-d we can derive from this, let us first analyze the meaning of the third month. That Sivan is the third month is not an incidental aspect, but a primary element. The Talmud (Shabbos 88a) states concerning Matan Torah: "The threefold Torah (Chumash, Prophets, Writings) [was given] to the threefold people (Priests, Levites, Israelites) through the thirdborn (Moshe -- born after Aharon and Miriam) on the third day (of preparation) in the third month." R. Nissim Gaon enumerates several other factors present at Matan Torah connected with the number three.

"Three" represents peace: When two parties are in a controversy, the third party makes peace between them, uniting them into one entity. This is the idea of the "threefold" Torah, for "the Torah was given to make peace in the world." Thus, although there are levels in the Torah which transcend the world ("plaything", "delight"), the ultimate purpose of Torah is to work its effect in this corporeal world -- "to make peace in the world." And through the Torah descending into the world, it is elevated to a level higher than before, when it was G-d's "delight" -- for it is specifically through its descent that the Divine will of making this world a dwelling place for G-d is fulfilled.

Similarly, when a Jew engages in Torah for the purpose of making "peace in the world" -- he does not closet himself with the Torah apart from the world -- he thereby fulfills the Divine will of making the world a fit abode for G-dliness.

2. We can now understand the connection between the "third" month and the "fourth" month. In Scripture, the fourth month is associated with tragedy and evil, as written, "the fast of the fourth." But the ultimate purpose in this is to transform the evil to good, as Rambam writes: "All the fasts are destined to be abolished in the Messianic era; moreover, they are destined to be festivals and days of joy and gladness, as it is said, 'So says the L-rd of Hosts: The fast of the fourth ... shall be to the House of Yehudah for joy and gladness and for festivals.'"

A tragedy transformed into a festival is a loftier thing than an ordinary festival, for it possesses "the superiority of light which follows previous darkness." Thus, there are two types of good: that which was always good; that which was once evil and is now transformed into good -- which is a higher level. Since G-d desires this second, higher level also, there had to first exist the evil ("the fast of the fourth") to be able to transform it into good ("joy and gladness and festivals").

This is why the "fourth month" follows the "third." The theme of the third month, as elaborated on above, is that the Torah descends below "to make peace in the world." The "fourth month" then follows, and teaches that a Jew must descend yet further -- to transform darkness into light. That is, not just to make peace in the world, but to transform even evil ("fast") into good ("joy and festival"). And one thereby reaches a yet loftier level.

The strength to transform darkness into light is taken from the "third month"; and therefore the Shabbos on which the fourth month is blessed and which provides the strength for service in that month -- is in the "third month." For one needs the strength of Torah (the theme of the "third month") to transform darkness into light: since Torah transcends the nature of both light and darkness, and in it one can see openly that the purpose of darkness is to produce yet greater light, it has the power to actually transform the darkness into light.

There is a lesson to be derived from the above for actual service. Some people think that since Torah is such a lofty thing, transcending the world, there is nothing better than to close oneself off in one's own domain and engage only in Torah. The concepts of the "third month" and "fourth month" teach otherwise: The ultimate purpose of Torah is that "it was given to make peace in the world," and further, to transform darkness into light. One must "lower" oneself to where darkness is found, and there bring peace and light.

This of itself is enough to make us go out to transform the world. But, as explained previously, through such service -- through fulfilling the Divine Will of making this world a dwelling place for G-d -- we also effect a level higher than Torah as it is a "delight" before G-d.

Simply put, although Torah study is a tremendously lofty pursuit, Torah itself teaches that saving life overrides the whole Torah -- Torah commands us to interrupt Torah study to save a Jew who is in danger of spiritual death. Even if one is in doubt if one's efforts to save this Jew will be successful, Torah law says that even if there is the remotest possibility that the Jew's life is in danger, the whole Torah must be overridden to help that Jew. Even the High Priest, during his service in the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur, is obligated to interrupt that service to save a Jew's life -- even if it is very doubtful that it is a life-threatening case!

So too spiritually: A Jew whose service is on the level of the High Priest must interrupt the most lofty of services to save a Jew who is in danger of spiritual death -- even if there is a doubt in the matter.

The above is related to the imprisonment and liberation of the previous Rebbe, who was imprisoned on the 15th of Sivan (the "third month") and released on the 12th-13th of Tammuz (the "fourth month"). The previous Rebbe jeopardized his work of disseminating Torah and Judaism to ensure that children should have a Torah education. He was willing to put his work in jeopardy for it was a life-threatening situation to Jewry (that children, the future generation, should not be educated in Torah) -- and as such, it overrode the whole Torah. And it was specifically through such conduct that the liberation of the 12th-13th of Tammuz came about, which led to yet greater success, in the manner of the "superiority of light which follows previous darkness."

All Jews must emulate his example: They must go rescue Jews whose spiritual life is threatened. For since "the body follows the head," every part of the "body" -- every Jew, must follow the example of the "head" -- the previous Rebbe, leader of our generation.

3. The above applies to Shabbos Mevarchim Tammuz every year. In addition, there are lessons to be derived from aspects peculiar to this year -- today's date (23rd of Sivan) and today's parshah (Korach).

An event which occurred on the 23rd of Sivan is stated explicitly in Megillas Esther. After Queen Esther had interceded with King Achashverosh to have Haman's plan to annihilate the Jews put to naught, the King assented to have orders sent to all provinces permitting the Jews to defend themselves against any who threaten them.

The Megillah then states (8:9-16): "The King's scribes were summoned at that time, on the twenty third day of the third month, that is, the month of Sivan, and it was written all as Mordechai had commanded the Jews ... He wrote in the name of King Achashverosh and sealed it with the King's signet; and he sent letters by couriers ... to the effect that the King had permitted the Jews ... to organize and defend themselves ... And the couriers ... went forth in urgent haste by order of the King." Then, "Mordechai left the King's presence clad in royal apparel ... and the city of Shushan was cheerful and glad. The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor."

The event of the 23rd of Sivan teaches us: When a Jew engages in the service of "making peace in the world" and of transforming darkness into light, there may well be obstacles, especially an outpouring of scorn from the nations of the world. The event of the 23rd of Sivan recounted in the Megillah teaches that the government of that day openly announced that not only will they not disturb Jews from engaging in all aspects of Judaism, but they will help the Jews in whatever they need.

However, although a Jew knows that the nations of the world will not prevent him from carrying out his mission -- indeed, will help him -- opposition may still arise from Jews themselves. As we see, there was a Korach who opposed Moshe Rabbeinu.

Korach claimed that one should not reach out to bring back Jews who have strayed from their heritage. He said (Bamidbar 16:3), "All the people in the congregation are holy": If they are holy they don't need to be brought back; if they are not holy -- they don't belong to "the congregation."

Korach did not want to "lower" himself to "make peace in the world"; he wanted to be High Priest. So great was his desire for the High Priesthood that he dared to rebel against Moshe Rabbeinu.

Parshas Korach, which relates how Moshe Rabbeinu was vindicated before everyone, teaches that one should not weaken just because there arises a Korach.
