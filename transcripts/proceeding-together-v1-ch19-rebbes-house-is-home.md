## 1. No Home: No Man

Chassidic literature explains the teaching that "A man who has no home is not a man," meaning a dwelling is essential to one's completeness. While food, clothing, and housing represent three material needs, only housing uniquely defines human wholeness.

## 2. Seeing Beyond One's Reason

Food becomes internalized, transforming into flesh and blood. Clothing encompasses the body externally yet remains closely tailored to individual measure. Housing surrounds from distance without customization.

These represent different spiritual service levels. Food represents service within reason's bounds. Clothing indicates service involving self-effacement, transcending reason while individual identity remains intact. Housing represents service utterly surpassing reason -- absolute self-effacement essential for human perfection.

## 3. True Self-Effacement

For chassidim, dwelling at self-effacement levels finds expression through dedication to the Rebbe.

An illustration: A contractor seeking blessing planned reconciling with family before Petersburg business. The Rebbe Maharash instructed him to conduct Petersburg business immediately, then reconcile. Bewildered, the contractor asked the reasoning. The Rebbe replied: "If you knew the reason you yourself would be Rebbe."

Upon arriving Petersburg, the contractor encountered the general departing for extended travel but returning to finalize the agreement that ultimately enriched him.

## 4. Nerve Center

This principle becomes evident regarding the previous Rebbe's house, serving as universal dwelling for the Jewish people. Upon first entering, the Rebbe stated: "May it be G-d's will that the prayers offered here spring from inward source, with true inward delight stemming from service."

## 5. The Privilege of Giving

The Rebbe doesn't accept contributions from everyone; discernment determines whom he permits giving. Once, someone offered household support. The Rebbe declined, explaining such giving comes from chassidim. The individual responded he'd become one. The Rebbe answered this wasn't where one begins.

## 6. The Life of a Tzaddik

The previous Rebbe once stated he came not receiving but giving. Even after the passing of the previous Rebbe, this blessed current continues unchanged -- the Rebbe still gives rather than receives.

A recent letter from a chassid referring to the previous Rebbe as "the Rebbe, may he be well" brought particular joy. This expression proves accurate because the Rebbe's health derived from spiritual rather than physical factors. As written in the Holy Epistle, "The life of a tzaddik involves not fleshly existence but spiritual life consisting of faith, awe, and love."

## 7. Getting In First

The Alter Rebbe snatching the fish portion intended for the Maggid of Mezritch gained richly. This demonstrates that worthy things require prompt seizing.

## 8. A Finger's Worth of Exertion

The previous Rebbe grants not only privilege but requisite power. One need only *begin* personal efforts; then the Rebbe provides necessary strength. The Midrash relates that R. Chanina ben Dosa, bringing enormous stone to Jerusalem, met angels asking: "Will you carry this stone?" The angels consented provided he joined "your hand and your finger to our effort." Thus accomplished, "they found themselves standing in Jerusalem."

## 9-10. The Publication of Sdei Chemed / The Esrog and the House

Connections exist between the esrog's distinctive quality and the Rebbe's house. The esrog is the "fruit of a goodly tree." The esrog represents the superior Four Species member. Though superior among Four Species, the esrog doesn't hold itself proudly aloft but connects with others. Hebrew letters spelling esrog form an acronym meaning "Let no foot of pride approach me."

## 11. Recharging the Soul

The previous Rebbe can invest a person's soul with faculties from loftier soul levels, even exchanging souls for more elevated ones.

## 12. Mechanical Mirth

The previous Rebbe once spoke of certain meticulous Jews observing the Code of Jewish Law without Rebbes who faced dilemmas when festive celebrations fell on Sabbath. Solution: clapping backs of hands together, pinching cheeks, singing "I'm happy, I'm happy...!"

## 13. Counting Years

People say money requires counting since it may decrease, disappear, or increase; years, however, which cannot decrease, disappear, or increase, shouldn't be counted.
