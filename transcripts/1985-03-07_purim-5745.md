1. The very fact that Jews join together with similar intentions, sharing a common goal is itself reason for happiness, for then, the unity of the Jewish people is revealed.

The Alter Rebbe described Jewish unity with a parable of a father who had many sons. The father's greatest satisfaction and happiness came when he saw his children joining together in unity, caring for each other. When one would give up his own personal interest for his brother's benefit, the father would be filled with joy.

This unity is expressed when we join together for a farbrengen, speaking words of friendship, and ultimately, decide to meet together again. Furthermore, we have joined together for a common purpose and goal.

The concept of Jewish unity is particularly related to the holiday of Purim. Even Haman, whose claim against the Jews was that they were "scattered and spread out among the nations," had to admit that they were "one nation."

This concept is also expressed in the mitzvos associated with the holiday. Both Shalach Manos (presents of food sent to friends) and Matanos L'Evyonim (gifts to the poor) express the oneness of the Jews and their love for each other.

The source for this unity is the acceptance of the Torah. Our sages explain that on Purim, the Jews gave expression to the commitment they had made at Mount Sinai.

Unity is an intrinsic aspect of the Torah. Torah was given by the One G-d. Though G-d has created a multitude of worlds and realms, their existence does not detract from His unity. On the contrary, they help express that oneness.

That unity is reflected in the Torah. Therefore, it had an effect on the people receiving the Torah. Though the camp of the Jews contained millions of people, when they camped before Mount Sinai, they joined together "as one man, with one heart."

The particular differences between Jews does not detract from this unity. Rather, they contribute to it and endow it with a deeper dimension. Every man possesses both a body and a soul, two entities that are, by nature, opposite to each other. The soul is a spiritual entity, "truly a part of G-d." The body is a material organism with 248 limbs and 365 sinews.

Man's existence depends on fusing these opposites, combining the body and the soul into a single organism with no separation between them. By nature, the body tends towards material things and the soul towards the spiritual. Nevertheless, in a healthy person, they work together as a single entity with the soul becoming the predominant factor.

The same applies to the differences among Jews. Each individual has qualities and potentials that his colleague lacks. When they join together, each one benefits from the qualities of his colleague. By coming together "as one man, with one heart," each one reaches a higher rung of personal fulfillment.

On Purim, there is an emphasis on both the unity between soul and body and also the unity of the entire Jewish people as a whole. Chassidic thought explains the connection between Purim and Yom Kippur. The two words share the same letters. However, there is a fundamental difference between them. Yom Kippur is a solemn fast. In contrast, Purim is a day of "festivities and rejoicing." The very same influences that are aroused through fasting on Yom Kippur are brought about through "festivity" on Purim.

The above must lead to a practically applicable directive. First, in regard to each individual's service: The emphasis must be on the unity between the body and the soul. Second, in regard to our fellow man: There must be a stress on unity.

The task of "making a dwelling for G-d in the lower worlds" cannot be accomplished by one man alone. Nevertheless, our sages taught that each individual is required to say: "The world was created for me." We must realize that we each have the potential and the responsibility to influence others and involve them in working towards this common goal.

This awareness will surely lead to happiness and joy. The latter is also stressed on Purim. Indeed, the rejoicing of Purim transcends that of the other festivals.

2. There is an element of this farbrengen which arouses wonder: According to Jewish custom, the Purim feast is always begun during the day and continued into the night. If so, the question should arise: Why is the Purim farbrengen held at night?

One of the reasons for beginning at this hour is to enable everyone to hold their own Purim feasts with their families. Afterwards, when these feasts are concluded, everyone can assemble together for a communal farbrengen.

However, this rationale itself raises a question. On Purim, we are obligated to become drunk to the point that we do not know the difference between "Cursed be Haman" and "Blessed be Mordechai." After a person has reached the point of "not knowing," in his own family Purim feast, what value is there in assembling together to merely repeat this service?

The answer lies in the principle that within this unbounded commitment itself, there are a number of different levels. The tractate Berachos concludes with the statement: "Torah sages have no rest, neither in this world or in the world to come, as it is written: 'They shall proceed from strength to strength.'" They never remain content with their present level, but rather, constantly seek to advance in the service of G-d.

The concept of proceeding from "strength to strength" also applies regarding service which transcends the limits of reason. Chassidic thought explains that the commitment which previously was above one's grasp and reach can become internalized and the concept of "beyond the reach of intellect" can take on a new and broader definition.

This concept can be applied to the service of becoming drunk, i.e. of rising beyond the restrictions of intellect, on Purim. Though a person goes beyond his limits to the point where "he does not know," afterwards, he can still proceed to a deeper level.

This is the intent of holding the Purim farbrengen at this hour: Surely, everyone carried out the mitzvah of the Purim feast in a full measure, reaching the level of "not knowing." Nevertheless, at this gathering, everyone is given the potential to reach an even higher level.

3. There is an additional aspect of the Purim festival which requires mention. The Megillah states: "These days of Purim will never pass from among the Jews and their memory will never cease from their descendants." Based on this verse, our sages commented that even in the Messianic era when the performance of all the 613 mitzvos will be "nullified," the observance of Purim will remain.

That statement requires explanation: How can the observance of mitzvos be nullified? The Rambam writes that all the 613 mitzvos will remain for eternity.

The Alter Rebbe resolves this difficulty explaining that, in this instance, the word "nullified" means "lose importance." As a candle is not noticed in bright sunlight, similarly, the brilliance of the Messianic redemption will obscure all other light.

Why is the joy of Purim so great that even when the joy of the other festivals will be nullified, the joy of Purim will remain? The answer lies in the verse quoted above. The emphasis on the remembrance of Purim was placed on "their descendants," the Jewish children.

Haman's downfall began when he met three children coming from their Torah studies. He asked them to quote the verses they were learning and each one recited a promise of salvation. When Mordechai heard these verses, he was overjoyed. Mordechai saw that it was the Torah study of the Jewish children which would ultimately annul Haman's decree.

The Baal Shem Tov explained that our sages' prohibition against reading the Megillah backwards can be interpreted to mean: "Don't read the Megillah as a story which happened then. Relive it as if it is happening now."

In that context, the Purim holiday should impress us with the need to devote our energies to "chinuch," the education of Jewish children. In this way, we will perpetuate the observance of Purim and the totality of our Jewish heritage and nurture the power necessary to defeat our people's enemies.

4. The Rebbe spoke about the importance of the efforts to correct the Law of Return to require halachic conversions. He emphasized that though this decree has lasted for over 15 years, the efforts to correct the situation should not be slackened. Each individual should use whatever influence he has to help correct the situation.

5. The Rebbe stressed the importance of spreading the campaign to study the Rambam's Mishneh Torah and, in particular, the conduction of Siyumim at the conclusion of the yearly cycle of study and celebrations in connection with the Rambam's birthday. He emphasized that even the gentile countries in which the Rambam lived have organized celebrations in connection with the Rambam's birthday for this year marks the 850th anniversary of the Rambam's birth. If gentile nations have decided to honor the Rambam, the Jews should surely do so; the greatest possible honor being the serious study of his great work.
