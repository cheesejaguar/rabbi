## 1. I Need My Sons

The passage opens with a teaching from the Talmud about Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi (Rabbeinu HaKadosh). Before his passing, he declared: "I need my sons!... Let the lamp continue to burn in its usual place; let the table be set in its usual place; let the bed be made in its usual place."

The Rebbe explains that the Hebrew word "petirah" (passing) also signifies transition or elevation. The Sages teach that righteous individuals continuously ascend "from strength to strength," never resting even in the world to come. At the moment of his passing, the Rebbe's declaration of "I need my sons" was particularly significant -- it assured his disciples that despite ascending to transcendent levels of divine service, his connection to them remained vital and intact. He was affirming that his need for them persisted regardless of his spiritual elevation.

## 2. Lamp, Table, Bed

The Rebbe describes how individuals typically sought the Rebbe's counsel regarding two categories of concerns: spiritual matters and material matters (though not materialistic ones). Each category comprises three components symbolized by lamp, table, and bed.

For material concerns at "yechidus" (private audience):
- Children (banei) correspond to the bed
- Health/life (chayei) correspond to the lamp, as "the soul of man is a lamp of G-d"
- Livelihood (mezonei) corresponds to the table

The teaching assures that all three concerns remain in their accustomed place even after the Rebbe's passing. He continues to answer requests and direct divine benefactions as he did previously.

For spiritual matters, the symbolism applies similarly:
- The lamp represents commandments generally, as "a commandment is a lamp"
- The table represents Torah study, which serves as both spiritual sustenance and garment for the soul
- The bed represents the spiritual state of those who have fallen through sin, requiring rectification

Even individuals in spiritually fallen conditions should know they are not entirely disconnected from the Rebbe. He responds to requests for rectifying blemishes and spiritual falls just as he always did.

## 3. How Can the Rebbe Relate to Such Requests?

A traditional principle holds that for a Rebbe to respond at yechidus, he must find some spiritual relationship within himself to the subject matter. The Rebbe poses a challenge: Since the Previous Rebbe is no longer clothed in a physical body, how can he relate to requests concerning physical matters?

## 4. An Intermediary Who Connects

Before answering the previous question, the Rebbe addresses another concern: Is it appropriate to address requests to the Rebbe? Doesn't this make him an intermediary?

The response invokes a fundamental principle: "Israel and the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He, are all one." Similarly, the bond between chassidim and their Rebbe is not merely a connection between two entities but becomes absolutely unified as one. The Rebbe functions as "an intermediary who connects" rather than one who intercepts.

Therefore, for the chassid, he, the Rebbe, and the Divine are all one. This resolves both questions: the Rebbe can respond to all requests because the bond between Rebbe and chassid is rooted in the very essence of each. The concern about intermediaries disappears when recognizing that the Rebbe represents "the Essence and Being of G-d Himself, as He has garbed Himself in a body."

## 5. The Rebbe Can Hear Us

The Rebbe states that the Previous Rebbe remains present with them as in the past, present in his room and hearing their discussions. The Rebbe once switched on a speaker to hear the gathering; this reality continues now, but more intensely. This occurs because the Previous Rebbe desires it.

## 6. Coming Home for Kiddush

The "Sefer Chassidim" records that after his passing, Rabbeinu HaKadosh would visit his home on Friday evenings wearing Shabbat clothes, recite Kiddush, allowing others to fulfill their obligation through hearing it.

The Rebbe applies this teaching to the present moment -- at dusk following the Afternoon Prayer service, Rabbeinu HaKadosh comes to recite Kiddush and remains for the evening.

## 7. Where the Mind Is

The Rebbe shares a personal anecdote from the Previous Rebbe's winter. He found the Rebbe deep in thought, leaning on his hand, expressing a desire to go to the Land of Israel. When the Rebbe mentioned the substantial work remaining to be done, the Previous Rebbe reflected briefly and acknowledged it was "a nice thought." Yet mentally, he was already in the Land of Israel -- "the essence of Yosef had already been brought to the Land of Israel."

## 8. Shabbos On Demand

A chassid once traveled from far away requesting the Previous Rebbe deliver a teaching of Chassidic philosophy. The Rebbe explained he customarily did this on Shabbat. The chassid replied that whenever he visited, it was Shabbat for him, and the Rebbe accordingly delivered the teaching.

The Rebbe concludes that through proper connection, every individual can experience Shabbat daily at any time. The Rebbe comes and recites Kiddush, enabling others to discharge their obligation -- nourishing their souls. Yet there is a crucial difference: this represents Kiddush accompanied by the Rebbe's intentions and his holiness.
