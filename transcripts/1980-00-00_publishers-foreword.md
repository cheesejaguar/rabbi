---

This volume contains a free translation of Sichos delivered by the Lubavitcher Rebbe Shlita in the Farbrengens held between Shabbos Parshas Yisro and Erev Rosh Chodesh Sivan, 5740, with excerpts from every Farbrengen held during that period.

The translations are structured to appeal to an English speaking reader who is somewhat familiar with the teachings of Chassidus. The Sichos are not adapted or altered in context, but are presented, with slight changes, in the same form and thought style in which they were originally presented. Great effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the translations; however, they carry no official authority. As in all translations, the possibility of inadvertent error exists.

Two major innovations are present: the footnotes and the index. The footnotes (which are in previous volumes) consist of those ideas which appear to be parenthetical to the text and are thus presented as separate ideas at the bottom of the page. All footnotes, except those specifically labeled as translator's notes are the Rebbe Shlita's words.

The index lists those concepts which are not expected within the concept of a Sicha of the Rebbe. For example, Shabbos, Pesach, etc. are all topics which are usually discussed at the appropriate times and are thus listed in the table of contents. Topics such as children, Russia, Mesirus Nefesh, etc. do not fit into a universally accepted context. Therefore these topics are found in the index for quick reference, as well as general topics within a more unusual context.

This volume is the fifth of its kind published by Sichos In English. Our intention is to make the teachings of Chassidus and in particular of the Rebbe Shlita available, through our previous publications and all those that follow, to many who were formerly unable to study them.
