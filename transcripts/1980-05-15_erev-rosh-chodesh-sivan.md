## Fasting and Divine Compassion

The Rebbe emphasizes that while Jewish law generally prohibits causing bodily pain, the Torah permits fasting in specific circumstances. He states: "the compensation and reward which the fast brings about is unlimited in nature" and surpasses the physical difficulty involved.

## Unity and Community

A central message concerns Jewish solidarity. The address highlights how thousands of Jews observing the fast together create enhanced spiritual merit, noting that their unified effort generates blessings in "sons, health, and prosperity in a spiritual sense."

## Connection to Sinai

The discourse connects the current observance to the historical encampment at Mount Sinai, where the Jewish people stood "as one man with one heart" to receive the Torah. This unity serves as a model for contemporary Ahavas Yisrael (loving one's fellow Jew).

## Practical Directives

The Rebbe proposes specific actions for the pre-Shavuos period:

- Educators should discuss Torah's significance with children
- Children should gather in schools and holy places
- On Shavuos, children should participate in synagogue readings of the Ten Commandments
- An emphasis on "We will do" preceding "We will listen"

Even infants from one month old are encouraged to attend Torah readings, based on the Tribe of Levi's inclusion in census counts from that age.

## Address to Soviet Jewry

The final sections include remarks in Russian directed at Jews behind the Iron Curtain, encouraging children to ask parents to prepare for Shavuos and attend synagogue services in accordance with Soviet constitutional protections.
