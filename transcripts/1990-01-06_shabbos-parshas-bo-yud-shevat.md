"And it came to pass in the fortieth year on the eleventh day of the eleventh month..." This year, Yud Shevat marks the fortieth anniversary of the Previous Rebbe's passing, the day when:

All of his deeds, teachings, and service on which he labored throughout his lifetime... is revealed and shines from above to below and... "brings about salvation in the midst of the land."

Our Sages associate the significance of forty years with Moshe telling the Jews that G-d grants them at that time, "a knowing heart, eyes to see, and ears to hear." Similarly, our Sages state, "After forty years, a man attains [full grasp of] one's teacher's knowledge." Thus, at present, we are given the potential to comprehend the inner intent and the essence of the Previous Rebbe's service. This, in turn, should bring about a new era in the comprehension of his teachings and the fulfillment of his directives.

The statements of Moshe mentioned above were made in the fortieth year after the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah. Then, the Jews were given the potential to comprehend, "all that the L-rd did in the land of Egypt... the great wonders... and profound miracles."

The exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah (and subsequently, the entry into Eretz Yisroel) are of fundamental importance to the Jewish faith. With the exodus from Egypt, the Jews became G-d's people. This distinction was reinforced at the giving of the Torah when G-d gave His Torah to the Jews within the context of this material world. His intent was that they would study the Torah and fulfill the mitzvos and, in this manner, refine this world and transform it into a dwelling for G-d.

The full potential for this service was granted in the fortieth year when G-d granted the people, "a knowing heart, eyes to see, and ears to hear," thus, enabling them to comprehend in full, "the knowledge of the Teacher, G-d, Himself."

The Zohar explains that the fulfillment of the first commandment, the knowledge of G-d, contains two dimensions: a) a general awareness of His existence and b) the knowledge of G-dliness as He is manifest in all His particular dimensions.

The wonders of Egypt enabled the Jews to attain an initial awareness of G-d as the verse states, "And I will take you to Me as a people... and you will know that I am the L-rd, your G-d." This was intensified at the giving of the Torah when, "You have been shown to know that the L-rd is G-d."

The completion of this service of knowledge, the comprehension of the particular dimensions of G-dliness, came in the fortieth year, as the Zohar continues:

The Jews had applied themselves for forty years to the commandments of the Torah as Moshe had taught them.... This was the instruction in a particular manner as it is written, "And you shall know this day and take unto your heart."

Thus, G-d's granting "a knowing heart..." to the Jews in the fortieth year represents the completion of the service associated with the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah. This prepared them to enter Eretz Yisroel where the fulfillment of the mitzvos and the construction of the Bais HaMikdash, generates the potential to realize the intent of the giving of the Torah, to transform the world into a dwelling for G-d.

This sequence of events is more than a historical chronicle, but rather, provides a lesson for us at all times. We recall the exodus from Egypt twice each day, emphasizing how each person must consider it as if he left Egypt himself. Similarly, when we bless G-d as "the Giver of the Torah," we use the present tense, implying that the giving of the Torah is always relevant. Similarly, G-d's granting a "knowing heart..." in preparation for the entry into Eretz Yisroel is of eternal significance.

Thus, when a period of forty years of service is completed, a Jew derives the potential to attain full grasp of his Teacher's (G-d's) intention. Greater emphasis on the above comes at present time since, according to all signs, ours is the last generation of exile and, through "attaining [full grasp] of our teacher's knowledge," we are preparing to enter Eretz Yisroel in the Messianic redemption.

In particular, the above is relevant in regard to the passage of forty years since the passing of one of the Chabad Rebbeim. Chabad places a stress on comprehension of the teachings of P'nimiyus HaTorah using the faculties of wisdom, understanding, and knowledge. Thus, there is a greater connection to "a knowing heart," and "one's teacher's knowledge."

The above concepts can be understood in greater depth through a more particular examination of the two quotes mentioned above. There are a number of questions raised by G-d's granting of, "a knowing heart, eyes to see, and ears to hear:"

1. Why must these potentials be granted by G-d?
2. The verse states that these potentials are granted "to you." What is the significance of that addition?
3. What do the three concepts "a knowing heart, eyes to see, and ears to hear" allude to?
4. What is the significance to the order in which they are stated in the verse?

Similarly, our Sages' statement, "After forty years, a man attains [full grasp of] one's teacher's knowledge," provokes certain questions:

1. The expression "attains," is somewhat problematic. On the surface, an expression like "comprehends" or "perceives" would seem more appropriate.
2. The Hebrew word used for "man" is Inish. Chassidic thought explains that of the different terms used for man in Lashon HaKodesh, Enosh refers to the lowest of levels, a weak person who cannot master his nature. Therefore, it appears inappropriate when speaking about a person who "attains [full grasp of] his teacher's knowledge" to use the word Inish.

These questions can be resolved within the context of the concepts mentioned above. The intent of the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah is the establishment of a dwelling for G-d in this world. When a Jew unites with G-d through studying Torah and fulfilling mitzvos, he can establish a dwelling for Him. There are two dimensions to these efforts:

1. the revelation of G-dliness from above;
2. the manner in which it will be received and accepted within the world.

Thus, the general awareness of G-dliness established through the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah is a reflection of the revelation of G-dliness from above, while the deeper, particular understanding achieved after forty years reflects the internalization within the context of the world.

This relates to the teachings of the Mitteler Rebbe who explains that in prayer, there are two levels of meditation: a general meditation, "Know before Whom you stand," and a particular meditation, connected with the meaning of the individual prayers one is reciting.

The general meditation has an advantage in that one relates to the essence of the G-dly light. In contrast, the particular meditation brings the matter closer to the individual person. The general meditation can cause a person to deceive himself into thinking that he is very close to G-d even when, in truth, he is very distant. In contrast, a person who develops a particular conception of the matter will not deceive himself in this manner. Indeed, the comprehension of the particulars will lead him to a deeper and more inclusive understanding of the whole. The general understanding, however, is beneficial because it gives direction to the particular meditation that follows.

This concept can be related to the two levels of the knowledge of G-d described previously. The general meditation parallels the knowledge of G-d achieved through the exodus from Egypt, the revelation from above, while the particular meditation is associated with the internalized knowledge achieved after the forty years in the desert.

Since the "knowing heart" that is granted after the forty years is associated with internalizing the revelation of the giving of the Torah, it follows that it, like that revelation itself, relates to the following two dimensions: a) the revelation of the name Y-H-V-H which transcends the world. b) the Torah was given to the Jews in this world. From the giving of the Torah onward, "the Torah is not in the heavens." Indeed, the Jews have a certain measure of dominion over the Torah.

Similarly, these two dimensions are associated with the level of fulfillment achieved by the Jews in the fortieth year. Therefore, the verse which describes the Jews' attainment of "a knowing heart..." relates that it is being "given by the L-rd," emphasizing the aspect of revelation from above and that the revelation is being granted "to you," i.e., indicating that it will be internalized within the Jews.

In this manner, the Jews will be able to reach a complete level of comprehension, not only the general knowledge which comes about through the revelation from above, but also the appreciation of all the particulars that comes about through a person's use of his own intellectual capacities. The full use of our intellectual potential is alluded to by the three expressions: "a knowing heart, eyes to see, and ears to hear," which refer to our three intellectual powers. "Knowing" refers to the power of Da'as ("knowledge"). "That see" refers to the power of Chochmah ("wisdom"), the "eye of the mind" and "that hear" refers to the power of Binah ("understanding") the potential to internalize ideas.

These intellectual peaks affect "the heart," and bring about an emotional response which, in turn, brings about change on the level of thought, speech, and action. This gives us the potential to "attain [full grasp of] our teacher's knowledge."

The latter expression implies that a person renews his entire being and bases his activity on a new foundation. He no longer acts within the context of his own limited existence, the base for his efforts is "his teacher's knowledge."

Furthermore, "his teacher's knowledge," refers to the manner in which the teacher comprehends the concept for himself, not the way he communicates it to his students. To express this idea in terms of the Jews' attaining "[full grasp of] their teacher's (G-d's) knowledge" after forty years in the desert, this implies that they were able to perceive, not only the aspects of G-dliness associated with the creation of the world, but rather the transcendent aspects of G-dliness which are above creation.

In doing so, this fulfilled the intent of the giving of the Torah, the establishment of unity between the world and G-d. This can be achieved through the knowledge of the Torah when "a perfect unity" is established between a Jew and G-d which raises up the totality of the Jew's being (even the lowest elements, Inish, as above) to "one's teacher's knowledge."

Since "from the Shabbos are blessed all the days of the coming week," it follows that the above concepts are associated with this week's Torah portion, parshas Bo. This portion describes the Jews' exodus from Egypt, "On this very day, all the armies of G-d (Tzivos Hashem) left the land of Egypt."

The key to the Jews' departure from Egypt is their identification as "armies of G-d." A soldier stands in absolute self-nullification, giving himself over beyond the reaches of his intellect. Even when he sleeps, one can appreciate that he is a soldier.

When this bittul which transcends intellect permeates through and encompasses one's entire being -- as explained above in regard to faith -- a connection is established with G-d's essence. "The simple commitment of a common person is connected with G-d's transcendent simplicity." Thus, in the ma'amar connected with the Previous Rebbe's passing, Basi LeGani, the Previous Rebbe explains how the king squanders all the treasures of the kingdom on behalf of the common soldiers for they are the ones who are actively involved in carrying out the war.

Thus, when the Jews were identified as "the armies of G-d," "the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself to them in His glory and redeemed them." Afterwards, for forty years, they internalized this service of bittul until they "attained [full grasp of] the Teacher's knowledge" as explained above.

The Messianic redemption will reflect the redemption from Egypt as the prophet declares, "As in the days of your exodus from Egypt, I will show you wonders." Thus, after the conclusion of this forty year period, the potential is granted for us to "attain [full grasp of] the teacher's knowledge" and enter Eretz Yisroel in the Messianic redemption.

On the basis of the above, an answer can be given to the many who have asked: What service is required at present in the fortieth year after the Previous Rebbe's passing?

This service must involve making a new entity -- within ourselves and within our surrounding environment -- which stands on a new foundation, the "full grasp of our teacher's knowledge." All the activities which the Previous Rebbe demanded of us: the study of Torah with diligence, fulfilling mitzvos b'hiddur, and, in particular, spreading the wellsprings of Chassidus outward, must be carried out with renewed energy, based on a new perspective. We must begin looking at things, not from our limited perspective, but from the perspective of "the full grasp of our teacher's knowledge," i.e., viewing things as the Previous Rebbe would have viewed them.

This means that it is not sufficient to add merely an additional aspect of service -- or even to add a new general body of service. What is required is to establish ourselves as an entirely new entity based on the Previous Rebbe's approach. Though this is a declaration of a general nature, surely, after consideration of the matter, each individual will appreciate the particular activities that he should carry out as a new entity based on "the full grasp of our teacher's knowledge."

Our Sages stated, "A person must say, 'The world was created for me.'" This implies that, in addition to the personal renewal experienced by each individual, there must be new activities in the world at large. Efforts must be made to establish new institutions for Torah study, prayer, and deeds of kindness which are permeated by the spirit of Chassidus. In places where an institution of this nature already exists, efforts must be made to open at least one more institution and, in places where, as of yet, no such institutions exist, to establish one -- preferably more -- institutions of this nature.

Since everything in the world begins with Torah, it is proper that effort be made to publish new collections of Torah in both Nigleh and in Chassidus, and in particular, in the teachings of the Previous Rebbe. Similarly, it is appropriate that on the day of Yud Shevat itself, increases be made in the areas of Torah study, prayer, and deeds of kindness. In the latter area, donations to charity should be made in multiples of forty.

May these activities bring about the fulfillment of the prophecy, "Those who lie in the dust will arise and sing," with the coming of the Messianic redemption. May it be in the immediate future.
