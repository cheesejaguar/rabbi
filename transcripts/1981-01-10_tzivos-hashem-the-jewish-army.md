The Jew has always known that his mission in life is not the mere pursuit of pleasure and gratification of base desires. His task is to bring light into darkness, to reveal to all that the earth is full of G-d�s glory. At many recent public addresses, the Lubavitcher Rebbe Shlita has stressed and explained the pivotal role Jewish children play in this task. They, and all of us, are soldiers in �Tzivos Hashem,� the Army of G-d. The true service and unswerving devotion of these �soldiers� ensures ultimate victory � the speedy arrival of our righteous Mashiach (Messiah).
