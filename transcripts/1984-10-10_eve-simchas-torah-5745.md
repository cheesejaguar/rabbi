1. On each night during the holiday of Sukkos, it was explained how the rejoicing and celebrations of that night must surpass those of the preceding night since "one must always proceed higher in holy matters." Accordingly, it can be understood that on Shemini Atzeres and Simchas Torah, our happiness should reach even greater heights. Indeed, the rejoicing of these holidays transcends that of the entire year.

In general, the festivals are characterized by happiness and are, therefore, referred to as "holidays for rejoicing." In particular, in this aspect the holiday of Sukkos surpasses the other holidays for it is "the season of our rejoicing." Within Sukkos itself, each day must lead to even greater rejoicing. Indeed, a person who does not increase his rejoicing will have fulfilled the mitzvah of rejoicing on a holiday, but he will have not fulfilled the mitzvah of "always proceeding higher in holy matters." Thus, Shemini Atzeres and Simchas Torah are the culmination of this process of celebration.

Furthermore, Shemini Atzeres (lit. "the eighth day of assembly") possesses a unique quality: The number seven reflects a state of fulfillment within the context of creation. Therefore, there were seven days of creation. Even the Shabbos, the seventh day is included for Shabbos added a necessary element to existence as our Sages commented: "What did the world lack? Rest. Shabbos came and with it rest."

In contrast, eight represents a step above creation. Thus, the seven days of Sukkos reflect the ultimate of rejoicing within the limits of creation and Shemini Atzeres, rejoicing as it transcends those limits. Furthermore, eight is referred to as "the one which guards [nature's] cycle." Implied is the unbounded rejoicing of Shemini Atzeres which will protect the rejoicing of the seven days of Sukkos, ensuring that its influence on the year to come will continue without being weakened or cooled off.

The influence of every festival (particularly, the festivals of Tishrei) should continue throughout the year to come. However, there is a possibility that this influence will weaken over time. The rejoicing of Shemini Atzeres ensures that the rejoicing of Sukkos will continue to have an effect on all the days of the year to come.

Furthermore, this rejoicing will continue to have an effect for all time. The happiness of "the season of our rejoicing" is a mitzvah. The word mitzvah is related to tzavsah, meaning connection or bond. Each mitzvah is a bond with G-d. Hence, just as G-d is infinite and boundless, the mitzvah and its effect on the days that follow are also unlimited.

"Deed is most essential." After the lengthy explanation of the elevated level of the celebrations of Shemini Atzeres and Simchas Torah, what is most important is the actual rejoicing and dancing. As the Previous Rebbe would say: "The mitzvah of the day is Simchah -- happiness." Listening to intellectual ideas generates a certain amount of satisfaction. However, that is not the happiness desired on these holidays.

The intent is celebration and dancing in a boundless, unlimited manner. Furthermore, there is no need to go out to the street to spread the happiness as was done during Sukkos. Rather, the intensity of the celebration within the shul itself generates an influence on the surroundings, just as the light of the Temple spread throughout the entire world.

This celebration will draw down the Alef, G-d, Alufo Shel Olam, the L-rd of the world, within the confines of the exile. Thus exile, golah, will be transformed into redemption, geulah, with the coming of Moshiach, speedily in our days.

[The Chassidim responded by singing a niggun with great joy. The Rebbe Shlita motioned to a number of individuals to recite L'Chayim over a large cup of wine. He continued:]

There are those who respond to the statement: "The mitzvah of the day is Simchah," and the call for great celebration, by saying L'Chayim on a small cup of wine. There are others who cover the wine with their hands so that I will not be able to see them taking only a small amount. Still others think they're wiser and try to hide so that I will not see them at all.

How silly to waste one's wisdom on such foolish matters! On the contrary, this is a time when a person can acquire the entire Torah with happiness. Generally, Torah study requires labor and effort. However, during these days, the entire Torah can be acquired through happiness. It's a great shame when a person uses his wisdom to run away from this opportunity.

2. In the name Shemini Atzeres, not only the word Shemini is significant; rather, the term Atzeres is also worthy of explanation.

The Rabbis frequently refer to the holiday of Shavuos with that name. The commentaries explain that Atzeres means "restraint from work." In contrast to Pesach, which is connected with the mitzvah of Matzah, and Sukkos which is associated with the Lulav and Esrog, there is no specific mitzvah connected with Shavuos. The only aspect that distinguishes it as a festival is Atzeres, "restraint from work."

This concept applies with even greater emphasis to Shemini Atzeres. Though "the mitzvah of the day is Simchah -- happiness," that happiness is an essential point that transcends all aspects of Torah and mitzvos, reflecting the essence of the Jewish soul.

This concept is expressed through the custom associated with Simchas Torah, Hakafos. Hakafos involves encircling the platform upon which the Torah is read, while holding the Torah scrolls enclosed in their mantles and dancing with great joy. This celebration is not associated with the study of the Torah. On the contrary, while the Torah is closed, it is impossible to study from it.

This custom raises a question: Torah study is a constant mitzvah, incumbent upon us at all times. What is done? The very opposite. The Torah is taken out while closed and we dance with it.

From this, we can conclude that the rejoicing of Simchas Torah is an essential quality, transcending all aspects of Torah observance, even the study of Torah. Therefore, all Jews, Torah scholars and simple people alike, participate equally in this celebration. Since this quality transcends all the particular aspects of Torah and mitzvos, it relates to all Jews equally, without any difference between them.

By participating in these celebrations three times: Shemini Atzeres at night, Simchas Torah at night, and Simchas Torah during the day, we establish a Chazakah, a fixed practice, which ensures that this happiness will be drawn down to the entire year.

3. During the holiday of Sukkos, explanations were given associating the Ushpizin, "honored guests," mentioned by the Zohar, with the Chassidic Ushpizin, beginning with the Baal Shem Tov and ending with the Rebbe Rashab.

Since Shemini Atzeres follows the seven days of Sukkos, it follows that there are also Ushpizin associated with it. It is logical to assume that the "Ushpizin" of Shemini Atzeres, the eighth day, will be King Solomon and the Previous Rebbe, the successors to the Ushpizin of the seventh day, King Dovid and the Rebbe Rashab.

The common aspect uniting the two relates to the difference between Sukkos and Shemini Atzeres. A Sukkah is a temporary dwelling. On Shemini Atzeres, we leave the temporary dwellings and enter our homes, permanent structures. Similarly, both King Solomon and the Previous Rebbe shared the quality of establishing permanence and stability within the world.

In regard to King Solomon, there are three manifestations of this quality: a) the construction of the Temple; b) the introduction of a state of peace for the Jewish people; c) the refinement of the entire world.

The major contribution of the Previous Rebbe was the spreading of the wellsprings of Chassidus outward, to every place in the world, to the most far-removed corners of existence possible. He intended that the light of holiness, in its most complete expression, the inner truths of Torah permeate and become a fixed aspect of every place in the world and transform the darkness into light.

Furthermore, the Previous Rebbe sent Shluchim, emissaries, throughout the entire world to spread the observance of Judaism and the teachings of Chassidus. The intent was to motivate a process of transformation. This is alluded to in his name Yosef -- "add to me another son." The phrase also alludes to the transformation of acher, a person estranged from Judaism, into a ben, a son.

The Previous Rebbe carried out his service in times of ultimate darkness as evidenced by his struggle against the oppression of the Russian authorities. He, himself, was imprisoned because of these activities. Nevertheless, these difficulties did not effect the Previous Rebbe at all. On the contrary, he proceeded with his activities to the point where his efforts transformed darkness into light.

"Deed is most essential." Everyone must resolve to take a more active role in spreading Judaism and Chassidus. These activities will nullify the last remaining aspects of exile and we will be able to proceed to the true and complete redemption led by Moshiach.

Every addition within the sphere of Torah and mitzvos will hasten the above. In particular, through the unbounded celebrations of Shemini Atzeres and Simchas Torah -- "happiness breaks down barriers" -- we will break down the barriers of exile and proceed to the true and complete redemption "with eternal joy."
