## 1. Transcending Worldliness

R. Hillel of Paritch explains that exile stems from the mixture of good and evil in this world. At levels containing exclusively good, destruction doesn't apply. The late R. Yitzchak Aizik quoted the Alter Rebbe: regarding elevated souls like R. Shimon bar Yochai, "the *Beis HaMikdash* was not destroyed at all."

The *Zohar* describes how Rashbi caused rain through Torah teaching, unlike Choni HaMe'agel who prayed. Rashbi engaged principally in the mystical dimension of Torah, the *pnimiyus*, derived from "the Tree of Life" rather than "the Tree of Good and Evil." Since the *pnimiyus* deals exclusively with good, destruction concepts don't apply there.

## 2. Receptors for New Light

The Sages teach regarding pilgrim festivals at Temple times: people came "to see" the Divine Presence and "to be seen" by it. This spiritual illumination required integration. The Alter Rebbe wrote in *Likkutei Torah* that "from every festival the revelation continued to be elicited... until the following festival."

Just as Temple-era revelations sustained vitality until the next festival, the *pnimiyus* revelation from Pesach -- specifically the recently published *maamarim* of the Rebbe Rayatz -- should invigorate Chassidim until the next revelation arrives.

When asked whether publication of previously-given teachings constitutes a new revelation, the answer is affirmative. The Rebbe Rayatz declared on Yud-Beis Tammuz, 5692: "When one repeats a *maamar* of *Chassidus* sixty times, one apprehends [the Divine] Essence."

The questioner asked: "Was something new expounded each time?"

"Not necessarily," the Rebbe replied.

Further: "Was comprehension enhanced?"

"For sure," he answered, "and the increment from the sixtieth repetition compared to the fifty-ninth was comparable to the difference between the fifty-ninth and the first!"

## 3. The Materiality of Angels

The *maamar* for Pesach states: "the song of the angels -- the manner in which they serve G-d by prostrating themselves -- is the nullification of their materiality."

When discussing heavenly angels, what "materiality" requires nullification? Every entity comprises matter and form, body and soul -- including angels. Though angelic matter doesn't interfere with divine service, since it isn't nullified before G-d as thoroughly as their soul, it requires nullification through their "song."

## 4. Feet on the Ground

Discussion of angelic divine service should relate to human experience. The Rebbe Rayatz once received two questions -- one about personal *avodah* (love and awe of G-d), another about angels. After answering the first, he declined answering the second, stating that angelic service didn't relate to the questioner's *avodah*.

## 5. Diverse Thrusts in Divine Service

Parshas Shemini opens with "the eighth day," discussing the superior quality of the eighth day of *miluim* (Mishkan inauguration) compared to the preceding seven days. During the first seven days, Moshe erected and dismantled the Mishkan daily. On the eighth day, he erected it permanently and didn't dismantle it. On this day, Divine fire descended and consumed the altar.

After describing these elevated inaugurations, the *parshah* relates the death of Aharon's two sons, followed by the prohibition: "you shall not drink wine or strong drink... when you enter the *Mishkan*." This death signifies *ratzo* without *shov* -- the soul's rapturous desire to abandon the body and cleave to its Source, without restraint.

That such lofty service required negation shows the Jewish people's extraordinarily elevated spiritual level. Yet paradoxically, the *parshah* concludes with prohibiting vermin consumption -- loathsome even by mortal standards. This prohibition relies solely on *kabbalas ol* (unreasoned acceptance): "For I am G-d Who has brought you out of Egypt to be your G-d" -- Rashi adds: "in order that you accept My *mitzvos*."

## 6. The Roots of Awe

Today's *Tanya* reading, after explaining that meditation enables any Jew to attain fear of G-d at lower levels, explains: "as in the case of a mortal king, the awe relates mainly to his inner essence and vitality and not to his body.... his inner essence and vitality are not perceived by physical eyes, but only by the mind's eye."

The accompanying note adds: "Even he who has never seen the king and does not recognize him at all, nevertheless, when he enters the royal court, and sees many eminent nobles prostrating themselves before one man, there falls on him a dread and awe."

Later, the Alter Rebbe adds: "There should also be a constant remembrance of the... acceptance of the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven."

A question arises: If meditation enables fear of heaven, why need *kabbalas ol* -- unreasoned acceptance?

## 7-8. Ascending, Descending, and Spiritual Transcendence

The Pesach *maamar* discusses five soul-levels' *avodah* modes descending -- first discussing the highest (*Chayah* and *Yechidah*), then *Neshamah*, *Ruach*, and *Nefesh*. The lowest refers to actual, practical *avodah* motivated by simple acceptance of heaven's yoke. Yet the conclusion reverts to *Yechidah*, the highest level.

It's inappropriate to question the Rebbe Rayatz's structural choices, as he transcends bounds of above and below -- at transcendence levels simultaneously tolerating logical opposites where logical problems are irrelevant.

The Rebbeim's task involves preparing the world for Mashiach's coming. Concerning that era: "And the glory of G-d shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see." People will perceive Divinity with fleshly eyes.

Previously, all who entered the Rebbe Rayatz's study for *yechidus* recognized him as a comprehensive soul, a *neshamah klalis* -- comprehensive in essence, transcending division into parts.

## 9. Lowest and Highest

On one hand, *kabbalas ol* represents the lowest divine service mode, lower than meditation. Conversely, *kabbalas ol* represents the highest divine service mode, higher than meditation. Mortal understanding is finite, comprising numerous detailed components, thus unable to grasp Divinity's uncompounded Essence, which is infinite. Unlike finite mortal understanding, *kabbalas ol* is essentially infinite.

The body's spiritual root, deriving from a superrational source, enables it to relate essentially to modes transcending understanding, such as higher-level *kabbalas ol*.

## 10. Endless Horizons

R. Menachem Mendel of Horodok told the Alter Rebbe: in the *Atah Hareisa* verses he perceived a hundred insights, but unable to translate them into practical fulfillment, he wanted to refrain from reading them. The Alter Rebbe replied: "The rule is, that whatever place one's eyes see from afar, there one cannot stand; and when one arrives at that place, his eyes will see another place from afar. Accordingly, when you translate these hundred insights into practical fulfillment, you will perceive yet further insights, insights without end."

## 11-12. Kabbalas Ol for All Levels

This *kabbalas ol* conception explains the Torah reading's progression from elevated divine service to basic acceptance. Because of *kabbalas ol's* supreme worth, transcending all other considerations, it is needed in all situations and at all levels.

After discussing *kabbalas ol* appropriate to the lowest soul-level, *Nefesh*, the *maamar* concludes discussing *avodah* appropriate to the highest level, *Yechidah*. This highlights the lofty standing of *kabbalas ol* transcending understanding. Such divine service manifests one's *Yechidah* -- called this because illumined by the "minute Divine spark," called *Yachid*.
