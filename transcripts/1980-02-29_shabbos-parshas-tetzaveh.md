## Section 1: The Torah Reading of Amalek

A discussion explaining why remembering Amalek connects specifically to Torah reading. The text notes that "it is a positive commandment from the Torah to hear the reading of Parshas Zachor," while other Torah readings are Rabbinic.

The discourse observes that Egypt and Amalek differ in significance: "The remembrance of the Exodus is a Mitzvah for all generations, even the Messianic age," yet Amalek remembrance occurs annually. The answer proposed suggests Amalek's remembrance "shares an intrinsic connection to Torah" because Amalek attacked Jews during their journey to receive Torah at Sinai.

The text explains that "Amalek did not oppose all aspects of Torah; they opposed the Torah as it was given on Mt Sinai." Torah existed before Sinai through patriarchal yeshivos, but only at Sinai did connection between Torah and physical world establish itself.

## Section 2: The Nature of Amalek's Challenge

Amalek's unique spiritual challenge operated differently from other enemies. While adversaries might deny miracles or promote spiritual laxity, "Amalek argued 'Surely there were miracles, and surely you must proceed to receive the Torah, but what's the hurry?'"

"Amalek's weapon is coldness; he dampens the Jewish people's enthusiasm." The text contrasts this with Abraham's zealous service: "rose early in the morning to set out for the Akeida."

Our sages teach that "Don't forget (Amalek) must be fulfilled with one's heart." The response requires both heart-service and expressed action: the Mitzvah demands fulfillment "with one's mouth" through deed, since "the movement of one's lips is a deed."

Amalek's second strategy questions divine control over mundane matters: "G-d controls events of great importance, but not the small things." This contradicts fundamental faith that "the turning of a leaf in the wind is a direct result of the Divine Will."

The proper response involves "two-fold" service -- emotional engagement plus expressed action -- producing "intensification of our efforts to establish fixed times of Torah study and to arrange public classes of Torah learning."

## Section 3: Unique Lessons from 5740

This year presents distinctive circumstances: "Parshas Zachor is read on the 13th of Adar," with "many new laws that take place this year, beginning with the fast being moved to the 11th day of Adar."

The proximity between remembrance command (Shabbos) and fulfillment (Sunday/Purim) creates "greater force." Additionally, the 13th falling on Shabbos carries dual significance:

1) Preparations for Purim receive "added strength from the influence of Shabbos"
2) The day uniquely represents when "the Jewish people gathered together and defended themselves"

On Shabbos, prohibitions prevent war commencement, so the verse applies: "G-d will fight for you, and you will be silent." This teaches that victory comes through divine power rather than limited human resources.

However, this doesn't mean passivity. Instead, Jews should "elevate the nature of his service to G-d." The service of being silent means "carrying out one's service in a manner of pleasure."

The lesson: rather than fighting Amalek directly, Jews can "defend" themselves by "rising above Amalek entirely, and carrying out our service of G-d with joy. This, in turn causes the nullification of Amalek's power."

This principle applies particularly to Torah study, which should reach "a level that stands above all disturbing influences." The text illustrates this through contrasting perspectives: while a family man with financial worries struggles with concentration, a higher level exists "personified by Rav Shimon bar Yochai. He declared, 'With one bond I am tied with G-d.'"

## Section 4: Parshas Tetzaveh and Self-Sacrifice

"Tetzaveh is the only Parshah in the entire Torah...which does not mention Moshe's name." The Baal Haturim explains this occurred because when Moshe prayed for Jews after the golden calf sin, "he told G-d, 'Forgive their sin, and if not, please blot me out of Your book.'"

This demonstrates extraordinary self-sacrifice: "Since the curse of a wise man will always have an effect...Moshe's curse, 'blot me out,' caused his name to be omitted from Parshas Tetzaveh."

The text emphasizes that "The sin of the golden calf was a very grave sin," yet "Moshe was willing to risk his entire existence for the Jewish people." Remarkably, "Moshe had sacrificed himself for the Torah...Yet, when the Jewish people were threatened, Moshe was willing to pray for them."

This illustrates the highest level of love for fellow Jews, exceeding even self-love. The Mitzvah of "Love your fellowman as yourself" finds greater expression through Moshe's example than through explicit scriptural statement.

The discourse concludes by connecting this lesson to Purim season, where Mitzvos of "Mishloach Manos and Matanos L'evyonim emphasize Ahavas Yisrael." The text encourages accepting "the lesson from this Parshah and dedicate ourselves to the Mitzvah of Ahavas Yisrael," promising that such efforts will hasten the Messianic redemption.
