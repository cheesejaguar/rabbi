The article begins with historical context about R' Zushya Willemovsky, "The Partisan," who received information from the Rebbe regarding accomplishments needed before Moshiach's arrival.

## Spiritual Accounting

The Rebbe emphasizes performing spiritual accounting (cheshbon tzedek) to identify areas needing improvement, including minor imperfections. This should be done joyfully, recognizing the Jewish people as "one body" that is "healthy in all of his limbs and organs, both spiritually and physically."

## Key Teaching

"The matter is not dependent upon anything other than Moshiach Tzidkeinu himself." The article clarifies this doesn't mean passive waiting. Rather, it references a later sicha where the Rebbe instructed Chassidim to "bring Moshiach," emphasizing collective Jewish responsibility.

## Understanding the Teaching

The phrase is reinterpreted to mean our efforts should focus on accepting Moshiach as King -- not waiting for external actions. This acceptance represents the final step before redemption, moving "beyond the slogans" to genuine inner transformation.
