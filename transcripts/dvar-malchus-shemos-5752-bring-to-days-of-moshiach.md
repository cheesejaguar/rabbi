## Opening Context

The parsha begins following the deaths of Yaakov, Yosef, and the brothers, marking "the beginning of a new era in the history of Bnei Yisroel -- the beginning of the Egyptian exile."

## Midrashic Teaching

"The reason for the subsequent redemption from Egypt was 'due to the fact that [Bnei Yisroel] did not change their names...they went down as Reuvain and Shimon and they came up as Reuvain and Shimon.'"

## Central Teaching

The verse emphasizing names "is also emphasizing the merit for which they were ultimately redeemed from Egypt." The Rebbe argues:

"The whole idea of 'coming to Egypt' is in truth the 'Geuloh of Yisroel'. The descent which occurs in the meantime is on the superficial level, but on a deeper level, the descent itself is part of the ascent and the Geuloh itself."

## Three Levels of Existence

The teaching references Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah's discussion of recalling the exodus, distinguishing between: Day (divine light), Night (exile darkness), and Yemos Hamoshiach (Era of Redemption).

Yemos Hamoshiach represents "a state of Geulah" where "the unlimited aspect of the Geulah is drawn down into the limitations of the reality of olam hazeh" (this world).

## Role of Leadership

"The chiddush of the leader of Yisroel is that he connects and unifies 'all the days of your life' of every single Jew and of all of Israel...specifically the Nosi has the power to connect and unify the golus with the Geulah."

## Contemporary Relevance

The Rebbe states regarding their generation: "All of the end-times have passed, and Bnei Yisroel have already done tshuva, and finished everything...all that is needed is that the Holy One, blessed be He, will open up the eyes of Bnei Yisroel so they will see that the true and complete Geuloh exists already."

The teaching concludes that Jewish practice must focus on "to bring to Yemos Hamoshiach," preparing for and recognizing the ultimate redemption through proper leadership and spiritual preparation.
