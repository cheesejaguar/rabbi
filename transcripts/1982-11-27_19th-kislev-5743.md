1. Whenever two Jews meet it is customary for one to open with a blessing "Shalom Aleichem -- Peace unto you" and the other to reply -- "Aleichem Shalom." The fact the greeting begins and closes with peace defines the character of the entire meeting that follows. It too should begin and close with peace.

There is an added aspect to the blessing Shalom Aleichem. Shalom is more than the Hebrew word for peace. It is one of G-d's names. It is natural for a person to turn when he hears his name called. Furthermore when his name is called with sincere feeling he turns not only his head but also his soul. The deeper the feeling invested in the call the deeper response it evokes by the listener. Similarly regarding calling G-d's name there is always a constant connection between G-d and the world for behold "creation is a continuous process." However when G-d is called by Name, by a Jew particularly if feeling is invested in that call, G-d turns and gives Himself over entirely to his people.

There are two added concepts to be learned from the blessing Shalom Aleichem. Firstly even when addressed to one individual the plural form of the word unto you -- Aleichem is used. This emphasizes that no Jew is merely an individual entity. Rather he is in the words of our Sages "an entire world."

Secondly the blessing reinforces the knowledge that eventually the world will be brought to a state of peace. Though we have free choice as the Torah teaches "I set before you life and death" that verse concludes "and you shall choose life" the latter being not only a command but also a promise that eventually the choice for life will be made. Similarly in this case eventually peace will prevail.

The above can be applied in our service of G-d. Despite the many challenges of the exile a Jew has the potential to stand firm and prevail against all the influences that conceal G-dliness. The veils and darkness of the exile are felt only in regard to a person's individual perception. In contrast when he connects himself with Shalom -- the name of G-d -- he receives fresh strength to spread the awareness of G-d and generate peace in the world.

These activities are possible because he is constantly aware that his purpose in the world is to carry out G-d's will. Thus he will be able to establish peace throughout the world, beginning with his own personal world to establish peace between his G-dly soul and his animal soul, and proceed from there to create peace within the entire world.

The power to create peace comes through Torah as the Rambam writes "the Torah was given to create peace in the world." This concept can be explained through the interpretation of a verse in the Megillah. There it is written "there is one nation scattered abroad and dispersed among the nations." On the surface it is difficult to understand. How can the Jews remain one nation if they are scattered and dispersed? To answer that question the verse continues "their laws are different from the other nations." The Torah the fundamental base of the Jewish faith allows for the possibility of peace and unity in a world of friction. Indeed our Sages explained that when G-d gave the Torah to the Jewish people Bilaam and all the nations of the world proclaimed "the L-rd is giving strength to His people. May the L-rd bless His people with peace."

The above is connected to Yud-Tes Kislev. The Alter Rebbe explained that he was reciting Tehillim when he was informed of his release. As he explained "Immediately upon reciting the verse 'My soul was redeemed in peace.'" In the Chassidic discourses of the Rebbeim it is explained that the concept of peace -- a victory without the need for battle or war -- is intrinsically connected with Yud-Tes Kislev.

This service of peace begins in the personal world of one's soul -- peace between the animal soul and the G-dly soul -- and extends to the greatest sphere possible; peace in the world at large; the nations making peace with Israel in a manner where "Kings shall be your foster fathers and their queens your nursemaids."

2. The concept of redemption has parallels for each individual within the context of his service of G-d. A Jew must be redeemed from the constraints of the animal soul and natural tendencies. The ultimate state of redemption will be that the darkness of exile itself will be transformed into positive factors.

Once a person is redeemed from the limitations of the animal soul he will naturally be aroused to love for his fellow Jew. Thus his personal state of peace brings about peace with others.

On the verse "My soul was redeemed in peace" our Sages commented "I consider all those who are involved in Torah study, deeds of loving kindness, and pray together with a community, to have redeemed Me and My children from among the nations."

The Rebbe Rashab explained that the service of spreading the wellsprings of Chassidus outward began after the redemption of Yud-Tes Kislev. Each of the concepts -- spreading, wellsprings, and outward -- carries within it a unique import. The word wellsprings refers to the source of Torah. Spreading implies taking those wellsprings and spreading them all over the world with no boundaries or limits. Outward means extending oneself beyond one's natural place.

The spreading of the wellsprings of Chassidus should not be limited to Jews alone but should be extended outward even to gentiles. The Rambam writes that every Jew is obligated to try and influence the gentiles to fulfill the Seven Noachide Laws. Furthermore one of the achievements of Moshiach will be as the Rambam writes to refine and elevate the gentiles until they also become aware of G-d.

3. This year Yud-Tes Kislev falls on Sunday the first day of Parshas Vayeishev. Searching for a point of connection between the beginning of Parshas Vayeishev "These are the generations of Ya'akov -- Yosef" and the conclusion of the previous portion which describes the descendants of Esav, Rashi explains that Ya'akov saw all the tribal chiefs descending from Esav and he became frightened wondering: "Who can conquer all of these?" and then the verse "and the house of Ya'akov will be fire and the house of Yosef a flame and the house of Esav straw" occurred to him.

The above provides a clear lesson applicable in our behavior. The present exile called the exile of Rome is related to the tribal chiefs of Esav. A person may often wonder "How can I continue despite the double darkness of the present exile?" To answer this question Rashi teaches us the potential to burn the walls of exile exists at present for "the house of Ya'akov will be fire and the house of Yosef a flame."

We must realize that we should not feel inferior or become upset at the secular influences in the world at large and within our own personalities. Rather we should realize that they are straw which we have the potential to burn. After this stage is completed each person will in the context of his own personal service merit the fulfillment of the prophecy "Deliverers will go up to Mt. Zion to judge the House of Esav and the Kingship will be the L-rd's."

Then the personal redemption of each individual will bring about the ultimate redemption of the entire Jewish people ushering in a state when "the Kingship will be the L-rd's" in the future redemption led by Moshiach.

4. Though "the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps" G-d desired that everything that occurs in the time of exile be clothed in nature. Therefore a Jew is forced to rely on the assistance of gentiles. However the Jews must not approach the gentiles with an inferiority complex as a beggar at the door. They must realize that the only reason they need the gentiles' help is because G-d desired this situation. Therefore they must proudly tell the gentiles that since G-d sent the Jewish people into exile they require the assistance of the gentiles for financial aid, for weaponry etc. Nevertheless the Jew must realize that in truth this assistance will come in a manner where "Kings will be your foster fathers and their queens your nursemaids."

Wherever a Jew is found he should never feel inferior to a gentile. Since we are taught "Place G-d before you always" a Jew must always feel that he is standing before G-d's Presence.

Every Jew who has a connection with gentiles or could establish such a connection should use them for the benefit of the Jewish people and the benefit of the world at large by stressing the observance of the Noachide laws.

A further point must be mentioned. In the reorganization of priorities a primary emphasis must be placed on the study of Torah and fulfillment of mitzvos. Trusting in G-d and realizing that "the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps" we must stress the strengthening of Torah which strengthens the Jew's security. A Yeshiva Bochur studying Torah does more to defend the Jewish people than a soldier on the border. We must also appreciate the qualities of the soldier -- he shows actual Mesiras Nefesh (self-sacrifice). Thus the two are like Yissachar and Zevulun -- each one possessing an advantage over the other.

May G-d cause every Jew to do what is dependent on him to live Jewishly with peace. May the redemption of Yud-Tes Kislev and its blessing have an influence on all the above and then we will proceed to a state of true peace with the coming of Moshiach.

5. As customary on Yud-Tes Kislev the Rebbe made a Siyum of the Talmud and called for the division of the Talmud among the Chassidim for the coming year. He also mentioned the importance of contributing to the charitable fund connected with Yud-Tes Kislev and Chanukah and activity in the ten point Mitzvah campaign.
