# What Do the Links of Hiskashrus Consist Of?

**Date:** After Yud Shvat 5710 (1950)

The Rebbe explains the nature of the spiritual connection (hiskashrus) between a Rebbe and his followers. He draws from classical Chabad sources to demonstrate that this bond persists and even deepens after a Rebbe's physical passing.

## Connection Through Torah Study

The Rebbe emphasizes that genuine hiskashrus is established primarily through studying the Rebbe's Torah teachings and maamarim (Chassidic discourses). As one source states: "True hiskashrus is attained by the study of the Torah. If you study my maamarim of Chassidus, read the sichos" and engage with the chassidic community.

## Beyond Physical Presence

A letter from the Previous Rebbe clarifies that the bond transcends mere physical encounter: "You ask, what does your bond with me consist of, since I do not know you by face."

## Continued Service

The passage concludes that the departed Rebbe's spiritual presence remains active in the world, continuing to serve and guide followers through the teachings left behind and the practices he established.

The talk illustrates how disciples maintain connection through dedicated study, communal fellowship, and observance of spiritual practices rather than physical proximity alone.
