A year prior, the previous Rebbe (Rayatz) sent correspondence to chassidim and Tomchei Temimim students in the Holy Land. He announced sending a Torah scroll and expressed hopes it would serve as a reminder to structure lives according to Torah teachings.

The previous Rebbe urged recipients to educate their children in Torah's ways and spread its spirit through loving-kindness toward fellow Jews. He called them to serve as "lamps" illuminating exile's darkness, awaiting the Redemption through the herald who brings tidings of salvation. He referenced G-d comforting His people and gathering the exiles.

The Torah is received daily through blessings acknowledging its giver. However, Shavuos holds special significance as "the time of the Giving of the Torah" for the entire year. During this festival and surrounding days, one should deeply contemplate the previous Rebbe's words, cultivating positive results throughout the year.

The previous Rebbe's passionate plea echoed: "What are people waiting for? The Redemption is being held up! It's already past noon on erev Shabbos!"
