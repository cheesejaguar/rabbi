�In G-d We Trust�:
Safeguard for Religious Freedom

The defeat of an incumbent President in an election is viewed by many as an opportunity for rejoicing in his downfall. Torah however, bids one to gratefully acknowledge the good which was achieved. But while Presidents may change, the office of the Presidency does not; and it is the duty of the incoming President to strengthen the foundation of our country, stated on every form of currency � �In G-d We Trust.� To ensure that such trust is instilled within every citizen, the proper education of children is mandatory. To this end, it is imperative that a simple non-denominational prayer be said by children at the beginning of each day.
