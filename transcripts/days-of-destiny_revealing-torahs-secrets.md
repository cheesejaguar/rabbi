# Revealing Torah's Secrets

**Occasion:** 9th of Kislev
**Source:** Days of Destiny, Sichos In English

---

The ninth of Kislev commemorates the passing of R. Dov Ber of Lubavitch, the Mitteler Rebbe. This date typically falls during the weekly Torah portion of Parshas Vayeitze, which contains an account of the covenant between Yaakov and Lavan.

## The Mound as Witness

The text describes how Yaakov and Lavan erected a stone mound as a boundary marker, saying, "this mound shall be a witness" that they would not cross it for harmful purposes. However, Rashi notes one could cross for legitimate business dealings. The mound symbolizes a permeable rather than absolute division.

## Secrets and Revelation

The author explains an apparent paradox: while Jewish tradition teaches that "one must conceal the Torah's secrets," both Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai (Rashbi) and the Mitteler Rebbe revealed mystical teachings. The resolution involves understanding the mound metaphor — the boundary between revealed and mystical Torah isn't permanent. Under appropriate circumstances, particularly when the revealer possesses a spiritual level aligned with the Messianic era, such revelations serve the greater good.

## The Mitteler Rebbe's Contribution

The Mitteler Rebbe expanded upon his predecessor's foundational teachings through Chabad Chassidus. While the Alter Rebbe exercised caution in revealing these concepts, changed circumstances permitted the Mitteler Rebbe to elaborate comprehensively on mystical principles.
