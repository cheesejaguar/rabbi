1. This year, 5743, is the 100th anniversary of the passing of the Rebbe Maharash; and on a yahrzeit (anniversary of passing on) the soul of a tzaddik experiences an elevation after elevation. The Rebbe Maharash emphasized that a person's conduct should in the first place always be transcendent. This connects to the Baal Shem Tov's legacy and extends through all the Rebbeim to the previous Rebbe, emphasizing how their Torah and conduct unified transcendent spirituality with practical earthly impact.

2. One should accept additional stringencies in mitzvah performance, study Chitas and participate in Keren Hashanah. May we merit the complete redemption speedily in our days.
