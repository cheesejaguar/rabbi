This Shabbos combines two themes: 1) the general theme of Shabbos Rosh Chodesh, and; 2) the theme of Rosh Chodesh Tammuz. Another important date in the month of Tammuz is the day of liberation -- Yud Bais Tammuz -- which also has an association with this day of Rosh Chodesh.

Normally speaking, Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh represent different aspects of existence. Being the seventh day of the week, Shabbos is directly connected to the rising and setting of the sun. On Shabbos the six days of the week find completion and are uplifted. Rosh Chodesh, however, is dependent upon the orbit of the moon, specifically, the appearance, or birth, of the "new moon."

Despite these differences there is an aspect of unity between Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh reminiscent of the unity of the sun and moon (giver and receiver). What is their common denominator? Both effect a gathering and unification of many parts.

Shabbos unites and encompasses the preceding six days, itself, as well as the coming six days. Rosh Chodesh includes and unifies all the days of the month in a radical unity, just as the head (Rosh) encompasses all the body's organs.

The unity which Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh bring also expresses itself in the conduct of the Jewish people for whom "the world was created."

Concerning Shabbos the Midrash relates: "The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moshe, gather large public assemblies and expound for them the laws of Shabbos so that the future generations will learn from you to gather the masses each and every Shabbos and to assemble them in the houses of study."

Thus, the general theme of Shabbos Rosh Chodesh -- which symbolizes the union of giver and receiver -- will also find expression on Shabbos Rosh Chodesh Tammuz. Tammuz is the fourth month. In the third month the Torah was given to the Jewish people, but it retained the character of the giver -- only in the fourth month did Torah infuse the beings of the "receivers" and take on the character of the Jewish people. In the third month we emphasize Torah as it was given by G-d: theory; and in the fourth month we stress the increase in Torah created by man: action.

In our generation, as a result of the liberation of Yud-Bais Tammuz, the restrictions and obstacles to spreading Torah were nullified and the union of the third and fourth months is intensified.

On Rosh Chodesh Tammuz there must be a reemphasis on proper action in all areas of Yiddishkeit, Torah and mitzvos and especially spreading Torah and Yiddishkeit in a liberated way without any restrictions. Through this we will merit the true and complete redemption, when no Jew will remain in golus and after which there will be no exile.

The shevi'i portion of Korach which we study on Shabbos begins with the words: "To the descendants of Levi." (Bemidbar 18:21)

The Rambam makes it clear that the spiritual level of Levi (or even Kohen Gadol) is within the grasp of every Jew:

"Not only the tribe of Levi, but also each and every individual...whose spirit moves him and whose knowledge gives him the understanding to set himself apart in order to stand before the L-rd to serve Him, to worship Him...such an individual is consecrated to the Holy of Holies, and his portion and inheritance shall be in the L-rd forever and evermore."

Today's Torah section transmits to us the Divine service of the "tribe of Levi" which reaches the Holy of Holies and which activates the person's "destiny," the essence, of the Jewish soul.

The Previous Rebbe always followed the path of self-sacrifice congruous with the state of goral. This state is often termed "the trusted servant" who has no self-existence but whose whole being is the presence of his Master. As the Previous Rebbe saw his release as a liberation for all Jews, his unity is transmitted to all his followers and to all Jews.

Therefore, you must go out into the street and meet another Jew. Tell him today is Rosh Chodesh Tammuz, when the blessings of the new month are revealed. This includes the days of Yud-Bais Tammuz, when every Jew finds liberation in matters of Torah and mitzvos -- beyond all restrictions.

In the course of Korach's rebellion we find: "Moshe became very angry (grieved). He prayed to G-d, 'Do not accept their offering....'" (Bemidbar 16:15)

Rashi comments: "According to its plain sense the meaning is: In respect to the frankincense which they will offer before You tomorrow, I beg of You do not pay regard (turn) to them."

At first glance this whole episode is illogical. What was the purpose of Moshe's challenge to the 250 men, that they should offer frankincense (ketores) in the morning? To publicly prove that the Holy One, Blessed be He, specifically chose Aharon. Therefore, why was it necessary for Moshe to beseech G-d not to pay heed to the sacrifices of the rebels?

Careful study of Moshe's words will reveal that although he was sure that G-d would pick His trusted servant and show who the true Kohen Gadol was, that would not preclude that G-d might also "turn to their offering." Moshe wanted more than non-acceptance -- he wanted complete rejection -- to once-and-for-always show how G-d hates disunity and strife.

The fact that the Torah directed the test of proper Kehunah to be carried out by sacrificing incense sets an important precedent relating to the ultimate redemption. The Gemara tells us: "It was a testimony to the house of Dovid that whoever was eligible for the throne [the crown] fitted, but it would not fit anyone who was not eligible." So we see that the coming of Moshiach -- the Davidic king -- will also be associated with an act that will serve as a test of eligibility, just as the ketores proved who was the true Kohen Gadol.

Providentially, today we learn the Rambam section dealing with the fruits of the fourth year. In Moreh Nevuchim the Rambam explains the reason for the prohibition of the first three year's fruits and the special laws of the fruit of the fourth year.

The negation of Avodah Zorah means not only idols (for that is obvious) -- but also any conduct that is "foreign" to a Jew and does not fit his position. A Jew must utterly disassociate himself from anything foreign to Yiddishkeit and holiness.

Then, the growth of the fourth year is "lofty" and must be eaten only in Yerushalayim by its owners. The Rambam rules that even a non-Jew may follow the laws of the fourth year fruit -- because it brings a level of purification in the whole world. And helps bring the ultimate perfection and redemption, and the dwelling place for G-d.
