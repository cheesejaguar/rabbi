May G-d bless every one of the supporters and everyone of the shluchim in everything they need. This is particularly relevant now that the majority of the month of Adar has already past and we are within thirty days of the month of Pesach.

This is an appropriate time to focus our attention on Maos Chittim, the collection of funds to help people with their Pesach needs. Similarly, we must focus on the spiritual dimensions of Maos Chittim, explaining the laws of Pesach to those who are unaware of them.

It is important to mention this now, because many of these matters, e.g., the purchase of dishes, their immersement in the mikvah, the ordering of kosher -- and particularly according to our custom, Shemurah -- matzah, require time.

As mentioned in the previous sicha, this week's Torah portion, Parshas Vayikra, begins, "And G-d called to Moshe," to the spark of Moshe in every Jew. This allows a Jew to create a Sanctuary, a place for the Divine presence to rest, within his heart.

There is a further point. When G-d calls to a Jew in regard to spiritual concerns, He also calls to him in regard to his material concerns, endowing him with all of his needs. In this context, we can appreciate the sequence between Parshas Vayikra and Parshas Tzav. Rashi notes that the opening of Parshas Tzav, has to do with chisaron kis, a lack of money.

This, however, should not be interpreted as referring to a state of need. Instead, it means that G-d grants the Jews ample and abundant blessings, and the Jews use this money for tzav, to establish a tzavsa, connection and bond, with G-d by giving tzedakah, and by bringing all the aspects of Yiddishkeit into their homes, and into the homes of the people to whom they were sent as shluchim. (I.e., in addition to the general mission of serving his Creator which each person was granted together with the Jewish people as a whole, he was given a particular mission to serve as a shliach in a specific place.)

This involves spreading the mitzvos of Pesach, i.e., the nullification of chametz,[395] and preparing to celebrate "a kosher and happy festival." In particular, greater potential for the success of these activities is granted as we approach the month of Nissan, a month of miracles.

Because of a Jew's involvement in these activities, a Jew will suffer some financial lack. But again, the intent is not that he personally will lack. Rather, that his use of the resources which he was granted by G-d will cost. Nevertheless, he will still have ample prosperity and abundance in both a material and a spiritual sense.

From Parshas Tzav, we proceed to Parshas Shemini. Shemini, meaning "the eighth," shares a connection with the future redemption for the number eight is frequently mentioned in that context. Parshas Shemini also contains a reference to Moshe's prayer at the dedication of the Sanctuary, "May the Divine Presence rest amidst the work of your hands."

May the Divine Presence rest amidst each of us, and amidst the Jewish people as a whole, in these final days of the period of exile. And may we merit, as our Sages say in connection with Purim and Pesach, "to join redemption to redemption," celebrating the complete and ultimate redemption today. Then we will proceed, "on the clouds of heaven" to Eretz Yisrael, to Jerusalem, and to the Beis HaMikdash.

May the Divine Presence rest amidst the work of our hands, and amidst the work of your hands.

**Footnotes:**

[395] In a spiritual sense, the nullification of chametz refers to freeing oneself from the influence of the yetzer hora.
