The Previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, demonstrated extraordinary self-sacrifice while leading Soviet Jewry during brutal communist oppression. When religious freedom faced systematic destruction, he maintained underground yeshivas, mikvahs, and educational networks despite severe personal danger.

On the fifteenth of Sivan 5687 (1927), authorities arrested the Rebbe in Leningrad's Spalerno prison. He endured beatings and interrogation in horrific conditions but refused to acknowledge his captors' authority. When ordered to stand, he declined three times despite beatings, forcing officials to concede defeat.

Released from prison on the third of Tammuz with a three-year exile sentence to Kostrama, the Rebbe refused travel that evening because it would require violating Shabbat. Rather than compromise, "he chose to remain in prison" through Sunday to preserve sacred observance.

His captors "deliberately released him on Thursday to force him to desecrate the Shabbos," hoping for propaganda value. The Rebbe's decision defeated this strategy.

Complete freedom came on the twelfth and thirteenth of Tammuz when the exile sentence was fully canceled. The Rebbe viewed his liberation as belonging to all Jews committed to Torah dissemination, declaring the day represented "the festival of liberation for Israel."

## Two Levels of Mesirus Nefesh

The text distinguishes between obligatory self-sacrifice defined by Jewish law and boundless devotion stemming from the soul's essence. The Previous Rebbe exemplified the latter -- risking his life spreading Torah when legally not required to do so.

His focus on educating children, though most dangerous, reflected his understanding that future Jewish continuity depended on this sacrifice.
