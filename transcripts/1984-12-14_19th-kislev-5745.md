1. The Alter Rebbe begins his first letter in Iggeres HaKodesh, which was written after being liberated from Petersburg, with the words: "We begin with a benediction ..." This gives a directive to all who follow his teachings to always begin with a blessing.

We also find at the conclusion of tractate Berachos, which is the first tractate of the Talmud, the importance of greeting and blessing a Jew with the name of G-d. The Talmud relates that when Boaz, who was the judge of the Jewish people, met his workers in the field, not on any special day or in any special place, they greeted each other with the name of G-d.

Therefore, when Jews gather in a holy place, where we pray and study and beseech G-d's blessings, for the purpose of encouraging and strengthening each other in all aspects of holiness, purity and good deeds, we must begin with a benediction. Since those who bless others are themselves blessed, we can be sure that we will be the beneficiaries of a complete blessing from above.

The individual Jew must remember that his role is to serve his Creator, by influencing all who come in contact with him; to bring peace and to reveal the honor of G-d so that all will willingly and joyously accept the Kingship and rule of G-d, meaning the 613 mitzvos for Jews, and the seven mitzvos for the other nations. Thought, speech and deed will then be permeated with the spirit of serving G-d, and will be "close" to us and quicken the arrival of Mashiach, as the Rambam says: "Immediately they are redeemed." Speedily in our days, Amen.

2. The Baal Shem Tov taught that the Hebrew name of anything represents its true essence and the Hebrew letters of that word create, enliven and sustain it. The word "geulah" means "redemption." The opposite of geulah is "goleh," which means "exiled from its place." These two words are similar. In fact, when we add the "aleph" to "goleh" we have "geulah"; the concepts change, indicating redemption.

The Talmud tells us that the letter aleph refers to G-d, the Master of the world. When we bring G-d into the galus, exile, in a revealed way, as an aleph -- not as just any letter, but like the aleph which converts the meaning -- it changes exile into redemption.

Here we learn a very important lesson. A Jew can bring the aleph of G-dliness into his life in exile, and although the ultimate redemption will not be reached, he will effect a partial geulah. If we introduce G-dliness into all of our activities of the heart, mouth and hands, then the redemption affects us and all our surroundings.

3. Our sages teach us: "That which occurred with our forefathers is an omen for their descendants." In the case of the Alter Rebbe, his incarceration was not because of his personal study, but rather because of his work in spreading the teachings of Chassidus to others.

In relation to our influence on gentiles, the Alter Rebbe also indicates that going into exile is not only for the purpose of removing a negative aspect from the person -- to cleanse some blemish from himself -- but also to implant G-dliness among those gentiles. They too should realize that they were created for the honor of G-d, and should accept it willingly!

Yud-Tes Kislev, the 19th of Kislev, precedes by a few days the first day of Chanukah, and the intervening Shabbos connects them. But there is a major distinction between the miracle of Chanukah and the 19th of Kislev. The miracle of Chanukah came only after fierce battles and divine miracles of "many in the hands of few" and "strong in the hands of weak." The miracle of Yud-Tes Kislev, however, was accomplished peacefully, the ministers and king nullifying the decree, giving the Alter Rebbe freedom and peace to continue to do, with greater strength, the same things for which he had originally been incarcerated.

Because of the suffering of the Jewish people through its history and, especially in its most recent history -- we must have the revelation of the wellsprings in order to understand and absorb the inner soul of Torah, and then, together with the revealed aspects they become one Torah, completely revealed, bringing the additional knowledge of the time of Mashiach.

4. Many times when speaking of world problems we forget about ourselves. Being that this is based on Torah, which is our life and source of truth, this involvement must be firm and true. Yet when you deal with world problems you might tend to forget "perfect yourself first."

At the beginning of tractate Berachos, the Talmud interprets the verse "redeemed ... in peace" to mean: "One who occupies himself with the study of Torah, and with acts of kindness and prays with the congregation." The Previous Rebbe has explained that by using this term, the Talmud wishes to teach us that one must be involved in Torah study just like a businessman is involved and immersed in his business. A good businessman does not sit at home and wait until some potential customer comes to him. He runs around looking for customers and does not desist until he makes the sale!

When the person lives this way, utilizing these three forces and establishing his life on the three pillars upon which the world stands -- Torah, acts of kindness and prayer -- then he will also influence the rest of the world and effect salvation and success. In this way we may connect the liberation of the 19th of Kislev, with the ultimate redemption of Mashiach, for which we pray daily.

5. The same will also apply to the beginning and end of the six orders of the Mishnah, the 310 worlds and the Shema at night. When we have Torah, even if there is darkness, we can take the different worlds, even those that may have burned others, and we make unity on an even higher level. We take the disparate parts of "echod" -- and connect them in a higher unity, and this will bring the ultimate blessing with which the Order of the Mishnah concludes: "G-d will bless His nation with peace."
