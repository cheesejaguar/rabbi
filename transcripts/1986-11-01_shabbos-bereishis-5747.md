Today is Shabbos Mevorchim, blessing the coming Rosh Chodesh. Rosh Chodesh MarCheshvan has unique connection to Rosh Hashanah, spreading its theme throughout the year via the Divine service of "And Ya'akov went on his way."

In general Rosh Chodesh shares significant similarity with Rosh Hashanah. Chassidus compares Rosh Hashanah to the head encompassing life-force of all body parts. On Rosh Hashanah, new creation occurs, animating all worlds for the coming year. Individual life-force animating yearly days reaches each day through Rosh Chodesh of every month. Rosh Hashanah divides its radiance into twelve paths distributed among twelve months.

Consequently, each Rosh Chodesh serves as "head" of the month, encompassing life-force of all days, as Rosh Hashanah does with months and year days. Rosh Hashanah functions as "head" for the year, generating life-force generally to twelve months, while Rosh Chodesh apportions it specifically to each month day.

On Rosh Chodesh MarCheshvan this commonality with Rosh Hashanah appears most clearly. MarCheshvan is the first Rosh Chodesh after Tishrei, when Rosh Chodesh theme stands independently, and detailed life-force transfers from Rosh Hashanah to month days through Rosh Chodesh contact and medium.

Shabbos too shares common theme with Rosh Hashanah. Just as all existence returns to original state on Rosh Hashanah, on Shabbos all worlds rise above time limitations, followed by life-force rejuvenation. Every Sunday resembles the first creation day anew. Thus Shabbos is Rosh Hashanah on weekly basis.

How translates this into expected Jewish Divine service? On Rosh Hashanah, we accept heavenly kingship yoke, making unconditional submission (bittul) commitment to the Holy One, which takes effect throughout the year.

The Rosh Hashanah theme that G-d requests: "Make Me king over you," represents basic and fundamental general Divine service factor. This theme suffuses entire Tishrei month: Yom Kippur, Sukkos, Shemini Atzeres, Simchas Torah and even weekdays after Simchas Torah.

This means even the first holiday, Rosh Hashanah, and its Holy One coronation theme remain felt during final month days. Thus we must now bring this "coronation" function into the "And Ya'akov went on his way" Divine service throughout the entire year.

At Simchas Torah close we proclaim "And Ya'akov went on his way." Actual realization of this going out truly takes place after Tishrei month conclusion, rich with holidays.

Here we find opportunity to infuse going "on the way" directive with Tishrei coronation as essential Jewish Divine Service ingredient. First evidence of this permeation appears in "Modeh Ani" which Jews recite upon every morning awakening:

"I offer thanks to You, living and eternal King...."

Is this not Rosh Hashanah kingship acceptance extension expressed in appropriate daily form?! This continuing homage and subservience is what Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan brings to following year days and months.

In today's Haftorah, "Tomorrow is the New Moon (Rosh Chodesh)" (Machor Chodesh), a perplexing point emerges. Generally, the Haftorah choice bases itself on similarity to Torah reading, or holiday theme. In the "Machor Chodesh" case, read on Shabbos when Rosh Chodesh is Sunday, the Dovid and Yonason story relates nothing apparent to Erev Rosh Chodesh theme.

Even more, it shows no apparent connection to Erev Rosh Chodesh occurring on Shabbos. The story about going to fields and discussing arrow-shooting clearly demonstrates this incident occurred on weekday Erev Rosh Chodesh.

[Note: These Machor Chodesh Haftorah questions remained unanswered by the Rebbe.]

In Torah's last verse we read:

"And in all that strong hand, and in all the fearsome acts which Moshe displayed before the eyes of all of Israel." (Devorim 34:12)

Rashi's verse commentary: "And in all that strong hand (this refers to the fact) that he received the Torah that was on the Tablets, in his hands."

If we interpret this verse according to Rashi annotators stating it speaks of his weight-lifting ability, then it should state "He received the Tablets in his hands," rather than "He received the Torah that was on the Tablets." Why does Rashi include the word Torah?

The explanation is found by referencing Rashi commentary on Shemos 31:18: "the words, kechaloso (when he finished) is written defectively to intimate that the Torah was handed over to Moshe as a gift (complete in every respect) even as the bride (kallah is 'handed over') to the bridegroom -- for in a period as brief as this he must have been unable to learn in its entirety every law."

Rashi informs us that along with all Moshe's astounding powers and qualities, he also possessed the ability to receive the entire Torah with all its laws and derivations simultaneously with accepting the Tablets of stone.

In this week's portion we study the verse:

"G-d made leather garments for Adam and his wife and He clothed them." (Bereishis 3:21)

Rashi comments: "There are Aggados which say that they were smooth as fingernails, clinging to their skins; whereas some say [that they were made of] material that comes from skin, as for example the wool [hair] of hares which is soft and warm and of this He made garments for them."

The five-year-old Chumash student is perturbed: just prior Adam and Chavah "sewed together fig leaves and made themselves loincloths." If they were capable of making loincloths, they could have also made proper garments. Why did G-d have to make them garments and dress them?

To answer this question, Rashi quotes the Midrash: G-d made them skin coverings. Clearly, this "garment" type, which attaches to their bodies, can only be fashioned and attached by the Holy One, Blessed be He. This also explains the need for both G-d Names, Mercy and Severity.

In the Rambam section we study today we learn proper mikvah laws. The Rambam teaches that according to Scripture, any gathered water may be used for immersion, but according to the scribes, drawn water is not valid for immersion.

From this halachic exposition we may derive an important moral lesson for our Divine service. The Rambam also refers to immersion pool laws in symbolic way and compares it to immersion in "the waters of pure reason" which is the Torah.

In Torah too there is the fountain which is wholly heaven-made, and the man-made cistern. The matters clearly set down in Torah are heaven-made and the projections of these principles as understood in the human mind are "man-made."

The symbolic mikvah of pure reason must combine the heavenly waters and the human aspect. An example of this would be the current emphasis on making for yourself a Rav. You must appoint the teacher for yourself -- one whom you respect and who will guide and teach you. No one else will place the teacher upon you; you must do it with your own good will.
