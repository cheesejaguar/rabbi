Each day of Sukkos possesses two dimensions, a general quality connected with it as one of the days of Sukkos and a particular quality associated with its individual nature as the first, second, etc. day of the holiday. In addition, the seventh day of Sukkos possesses a further dimension as implied by the special name, Hosha'ana Rabbah, which is given to it.

As mentioned on the previous nights, we must increase our celebration and rejoicing on each day of Sukkos as implied by the general principle, "Always increase in regard to holy matters." In particular, this applies in regard to Simchas Bais Hashoevah. This obligation does not indicate that there was anything lacking in the previous days, but rather, since we are dealing with a holy matter, there must be an increase. Thus, tonight we must add to our rejoicing even though the celebration of Simchas Bais Hashoevah on the previous nights was complete.

Surely, the latter statement is true. Throughout the entire year, Jewish law operates on the assumption that a Jew behaves as Torah requires of him. This definitely applies in the month of Tishrei, and in particular, on the holiday of Sukkos, when all spiritual qualities, including the true level of the Jewish people, are revealed.

We find a parallel to this concept in Torah law. Though throughout the year, the Sages would consider the unlearned people as ritually impure, during the festivals, they were considered as ritually pure. This is associated with their appearance before G-d in the Temple. Our Sages stated: "Just as they would come to present themselves before G-d, they would come to witness the revelation of the Divine Presence." Thus, every Jew including even a young child who would be able to make the journey to Jerusalem holding on to his father's hand would witness the revelation of the Divine Presence.

This concept is still reflected at present, while we are in exile. Even though the physical Temple is destroyed, the spiritual Temple, which revolves upon the Divine Presence resting in the heart of every Jew, is still intact. Indeed, G-d's command to build the Sanctuary in the desert, the source for the mitzvah to construct all future Sanctuaries and Temples, includes an allusion to the inner Sanctuary which each Jew possesses within his heart.

Thus, even though the physical Temple is destroyed, within the heart of every Jew, all the spiritual services performed in the Temple may be continued. On that basis, our Sages established the prayer services as compensation for the Temple sacrifices. Therefore, the tremendous celebration that was held in the Temple on the nights of Sukkos should also be paralleled in our service.

On this basis, we can understand the uniqueness of the seventh night of Sukkos. On each night of Sukkos, the celebrations were intensified and increased in comparison with the previous nights. Thus, on the seventh night, we reach a peak that was not achieved on any of the previous nights. In addition, this night possesses a unique quality as emphasized by the special name, Hosha'ana Rabbah, that it was given.

The literal translation of that name is "great salvation." "Great" implies an aspect that transcends all boundaries and limitations, for as long as a quality has a limit, it cannot be truly deemed as "great."

This dimension is reflected in the Hosha'nos -- the prayers of praise that follow an alphabetical sequence and come as a continuation of the Hallel -- recited on Hosha'ana Rabbah. Hosha'nos are recited on each day of Sukkos. However, on Hosha'ana Rabbah, we recite many more Hosha'nos than on the previous days. Furthermore, we repeat -- and thus lift to a higher rung -- all the Hosha'nos that were recited previously.

This unlimited dimension of Hosha'ana Rabbah is also related to its connection with the seventh day of Sukkos. Our Sages taught: "All sevenths are dear." Thus, a measure of dearness that surpassed that bestowed upon all his predecessors was granted to Moshe, the seventh of the leaders of our people. Similarly, though there is a measure of dearness associated with each of the days of Sukkos, for they are all days of the festival, the aspect of dearness associated with Hosha'ana Rabbah surpasses all others.

[This quality receives greater emphasis this year -- the Shemittah (seventh) year].

The above is also associated with the Ushpizin of the present night, King Dovid and the Rebbe Rashab. The unique dearness of the seventh also relates to them. Thus, we find that the Hosha'nos recited on Hosha'ana Rabbah refer to Dovid: "Who exulted, danced, and sang; who studied Torah with the accompaniment of musical instruments," and, "There has appeared a man, his name is Tzemach; it is Dovid, himself."

The aspect of seven is also intrinsically connected with King Dovid who lived seventy years; i.e., seven ten year periods (for as we see in Pirkei Avos, our lives are divided into epochs of ten years). Furthermore, in those seventy years of life, King Dovid reached such a high level of fulfillment that even after his passing, on each Saturday night, we eat the Melaveh Malkah feast in his honor and, each month, when we consecrate the new moon, we proclaim: "King Dovid is living and enduring."

There is an additional aspect to the above: In general, our service involves the study of Torah and the fulfillment of mitzvos. Between the two, precedence is given to the study of Torah as our Sages commented, "Torah study is equivalent to them all (i.e., all the mitzvos)." Furthermore, even within the context of the fulfillment of mitzvos, Torah study is also considered as a mitzvah and possesses a unique advantage over the other mitzvos.

There are many mitzvos which are connected with a certain time or circumstance. On a higher rung are the six mitzvos which we are constantly obligated to fulfill: believing in G-d, loving Him, fearing Him, etc. However, even in regard to these mitzvos, the intent is not that in each moment, all of these mitzvos must be felt with equal force. On the contrary, there are times when the service of love is emphasized and, other occasions, when the stress is on fear.

In contrast, the obligation to study Torah is incumbent on a person every moment of the day. Indeed, if a person were to study Torah the entire day and spend one moment not studying Torah (or not involved in activities which Torah deems necessary) is considered to have "neglected Torah study" and is subject to the strict words of censure quoted by the Alter Rebbe in the first chapter of Tanya.

Furthermore, when Torah is studied in a complete manner, a person's entire body is involved. It is not enough to think about the Torah one studies, one must actually vocalize the words of Torah. Also, not only one's mouth, but one's entire body should become involved in the process of study. Thus, our Sages declared, "If one's Torah is wound up with one's 248 limbs, it will be protected." Hence, we see how, even from the standpoint of mitzvos, the study of Torah possesses a unique position.

[It must be emphasized that during this year, the Shemittah year, greater emphasis is placed on Torah study. Generally, the large majority of the Jewish people spend most of their time in worldly occupations, earning a livelihood. Though they also must establish fixed times for Torah study, it is only a select few who are able to devote their entire attention to Torah study. Nevertheless, in the Shemittah year, all agricultural work comes to a halt and all Jews can dedicate their time to Torah study.]

The unique dearness associated with the number seven is also connected with Torah for we find that our Sages spoke of the Torah as having seven books. Though generally we speak of the five books of Moshe, our Sages explain that the Book of Numbers actually contains within it three books. The two verses beginning, Vayihi B'nsoa HaAron... -- (Whenever the Ark set out...) are considered as a "Book" and for this reason are surrounded by inverted nunnim in the Torah. Thus, the portion of Numbers before this verse is one book, these two verses a second, and the latter portion of Numbers, a third. Together with the other four books, we reach a total of seven.

The aspect of Torah is also related to the celebrations of Simchas Bais Hashoevah and the Ushpizin of the present night. The celebrations of Simchas Bais Hashoevah are associated with the verse: "And you shall draw water with joy from the wellsprings of deliverance." Both "water" and "the wellsprings of deliverance" are metaphors for Torah. Similarly, the Book of Psalms authored by King Dovid parallels the Torah. It is divided into five books, but also subdivided into seven portions, each one corresponding to one of the days of the week. The Rebbe Rashab is also connected with Torah as emphasized by his founding of the Yeshivah Tomchei Temimim. There, the students reached a level of completion in Torah study, learning Pnimiyus HaTorah with the same depth of comprehension as one learns a subject in Nigleh, the legal realm of Torah study.

The two verses: "Whenever the Ark set out... And when it came to rest...", which is central to the concept of the seven books of the Torah communicates three basic points: a) an emphasis of the aspect of the ark; b) the ark's "setting out," i.e., its effect in the world at large; c) its coming to rest, which is related to the concept explained on the second night of Sukkos, "Do not abandon your place."

Thus, the unique dearness of seven that is associated with the Torah is related to the ark "setting out" and bringing about change in the world. This is related to the description by the Previous Rebbe in the ma'amar, Bosi L'Gani, of Moshe, as the seventh of the righteous upon whom a unique dearness was bestowed. How was that dearness expressed? He was the one who brought the Shechinah to the world; i.e., the dearness of the seventh is associated with the revelation of G-dliness with the world.

Also, it is possible to derive a lesson from today's portion of the Psalms. This is particularly significant on the present night for Psalms was authored by King Dovid, "the sweet singer of Israel," who is the Ushpizin of the present night.

Today's portion of Psalms contains two Psalms: The first Psalm begins with the verse: "My soul, bless the L-rd," and the second Psalm concludes with the verse: "so that they might observe His statutes and keep His Torahs." Both Psalms also conclude with the exclamation: "Halleluyah!"

The first Psalm is associated with King Dovid, and the second Psalm, with the Rebbe Rashab. Our Sages explain that the Psalm, "Let my soul bless the L-rd," was written by King Dovid and reflects the relationship between the soul and G-d; "just as the soul fills up the body, G-dliness fills up the world." Thus, it is associated with the Or HaMemale Kol Almin, the G-dly light which enclothes itself within creation. This light has its source in the Sefirah of Malchus, the seventh Sefirah, which is associated with King Dovid.

The verse, "so that they might observe His statutes and keep His Torahs," uses the plural for Torah, implying the combination of Nigleh and Pnimiyus HaTorah in a unified program of study as was fostered by the Rebbe Rashab by founding Yeshivas Tomchei Temimim.

It is also necessary to derive a lesson from the Torah portion connected with the present day. That portion is from the sixth Aliyah in Parshas Zos HaBerachah. That Aliyah contains the verse: "Happy are you, Israel!"

On this verse, Rashi comments: After Moshe mentioned the particular blessings for each tribe, he told them, "Why must I mention all the particulars? The general rule is: 'Everything is yours.'" Thus, this portion expresses the conclusion and the sum total of the blessings which Moshe, described as "one who loved Israel," gave the Jews. He told them: "This is the blessing...," i.e., the blessing was concrete to the extent that he could point to it and say, "This is it," and concludes with this general blessing that transcends all particulars.

This blessing is also connected with the seventh day of Sukkos and its Ushpizin, King Dovid. As the Midrash comments: Dovid began [the Book Of Psalms] where Moshe concluded. Moshe concluded, "Happy are you, Israel." Dovid began: "Happy is the man...." The Book of Psalms, in turn, concludes with the exclamation, "Halleluyah," which is also the conclusion of today's portion of Psalms.

Also, a reminder should be made regarding the custom of eating an apple dipped in honey on Hosha'ana Rabbah. This is an extension of the more widespread custom of eating an apple dipped in honey on Rosh Hashanah.

May this custom bring everyone a good and sweet year, including the ultimate good -- the coming of the Moshiach. This will be hastened by an increase in joy, an increase in singing and dancing, until we merit the ultimate dance of celebration with the coming of Moshiach, speedily, in our days.
