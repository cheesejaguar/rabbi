## 1: The Meaning of Elul

This Shabbos marks the blessing of the month of Elul, the final month of the Jewish year. Elul serves as a period for reviewing one's spiritual service throughout the year. The name Elul is interpreted as an acronym for "I am my Beloved's and my Beloved is mine," representing a twofold connection between Jews and G-d.

The first phrase emphasizes Jewish initiative in serving G-d and elevating the physical world. The second phrase reflects the drawing down of Divine influence and assistance. According to the text, "service on one's own initiative is the foundation of all service."

The concept of self-initiated service reflects human nature: people appreciate what they have earned more than what they have received without effort. This fundamental principle underlies all spiritual accomplishment.

Two days comprise Rosh Chodesh Elul this year: one falls on Shabbos, representing spiritual revelation from Above; the other falls on Sunday, symbolizing the service of elevating the material world. Both aspects require attention during the month of Elul.

The text explains that the week begins on Sunday, not Friday when creation was completed, to emphasize that "the essential goal of our service is transforming this world" into G-d's dwelling place. This reflects how all creation exists for the sake of the Jewish people and Torah.

Jews possess souls -- "an actual part of G-d from Above" -- and physical bodies made from dust. The body requires gradual refinement through physical service, while the soul receives revelation from Above. Both services are interconnected and necessary.

The two types of service correspond to the biblical categories of Yissachar (Torah scholars, receiving revelation) and Zevulun (those in commerce, elevating the material world). However, self-initiated service of elevating the physical realm holds primary importance.

The accounting in Elul must be threefold: examining one's self-initiated service, one's receptiveness to Divine revelation, and how successfully one has fused these two approaches. This accounting is not merely personal; "a single mitzvah performed by one individual has the power to tip the balance of the entire world and bring salvation."

## 2: Connection to the Redemption

The weekly Torah portion, Parshas Eikev, relates to the present era described as "Ikvesa d'Meshicha" (the heel of Mashiach). This term has two interpretations: the lowest spiritual level preceding redemption, characterized by darkness; or the final stage directly before Mashiach's arrival.

The text states these interpretations are interconnected: precisely when Jews reach the lowest levels, the ultimate fulfillment will occur. According to the Previous Rebbe, all required spiritual service has been "polished," and the Jewish people await redemption urgently.

The text emphasizes that according to all signs mentioned by our Sages, "the ultimate Redemption should have come already, and in this year." This urgency stems from recently witnessed miracles. A Jew possesses the capacity to arouse themselves, others, and Divine response.

Studying the laws of the Beis HaMikdash (Temple construction) hastens Mashiach's coming, as this study is considered equivalent to actual building. The Beis HaMikdash is "completely built in the spiritual realms" and only requires descent to the physical world.

The timing is particularly significant: this Shabbos occurs after the fifteenth of Av, associated with increased Torah study, during Elul when "the King is in the field" and grants all requests. Thus, this moment provides both potential and responsibility to call out: "Until when must we remain in exile."
