1. This year, Shabbos Parshas Lech Lecha falls on the day after the seventh of Cheshvan which was singled out by our sages as the end of the pilgrimage season. On this date, the Jews living in the farthest reaches of Eretz Yisroel were able to arrive home after their journey to Yerushalayim for the Sukkos holiday.

The influence of the festival was felt during the entire journey home as obvious from our Sages' comments on Shemos 34:24: "A person shall not covet your house while you go up to see the Presence of the L-rd, your G-d." They explain that this blessing applied until the Jews returned home, that G-d would send angels to watch the Jews' homes.

Thus, the seventh of Cheshvan, the completion of the journey home for the entire Jewish people, marks a transition from the heights of the festivals to the involvement in worldly affairs as implied by the verse "and Ya'akov went on his way."

This does not represent a descent in a Jew's service. True, he is no longer in Yerushalayim, no longer in the Temple. Rather, he is very far away, in the furthest reaches of Eretz Yisroel. Furthermore, instead of witnessing the open revelation of G-dliness as he did in the Temple, he is involved in everyday affairs. Nevertheless, precisely in such a situation does one have the potential to reach even greater heights.

The most complete happiness a Jew feels is through the fulfillment of G-d's will. G-d "desired a dwelling place in the lower worlds," i.e. He wanted a Jew to involve himself in material things and within that context, live as a Jew. Therefore, when a Jew involves himself in these activities he fulfills G-d's will and this, in turn, grants him the highest degree of satisfaction.

Furthermore, this satisfaction is intensified by the realization that a Jew's involvement in material things is "desired" by G-d. Desire refers to a level above normal will, transcending understanding, as the Alter Rebbe explains "no questions can be asked in regard to desire."

Thus, though on an obvious level, the entrance into Eretz Yisroel represents a descent, it must be considered a "descent for the purpose of ascent." It is only through this "descent" that G-d's desire for a "dwelling place within the lower worlds" can be fulfilled.

The practical lesson that can be derived from the above is: The seventh of Cheshvan is the final stage of the beginnings of the service of "Ya'akov went on his way." A Jew might complain: "I want a rest. After the intensity of accepting G-d as King on Rosh HaShanah, the celebrating after the completion of the Torah on Simchas Torah, I'd like a chance to breathe."

In reply, we quote our Sages' statement: "Talmidei Chachamim have no rest, neither in this world or the next as it is written, 'They shall proceed from strength to strength.'" A Jew must always proceed forward. There is no possibility for him to rest, not even for a moment.

The Alter Rebbe told his students that they must "live with the times," adapt their lives to the lessons to be derived from the weekly Torah portion. Thus, it is fitting that the seventh of Cheshvan falls in the portion of Lech Lecha, which also communicates how a Jew must continually proceed and journey forward.

In particular, Lech Lecha refers to the journey abandoning one's native land and place of residence. A Jew is not even granted the security of knowing where he is going. Rather, G-d conceals this from him in order to "make it precious for him and give him reward for each specific command."

The Midrash explains that on the journey Avraham took with him: "the souls he had made in Charan," the people who he and Sarah had been able to convince to accept his lifestyle. The name Charan is related to "Charan Af," furious anger, i.e. a place which aroused G-d's anger. Even in Charan, Avraham and Sarah were able to influence people to follow their lifestyle.

The same applies to the heirs of Avraham and Sarah, each and every Jew and Jewess. They must realize that they have been sent to Charan, i.e. the lowest places of the world, for a purpose, to fulfill the mission of Avraham and Sarah, by bringing people "under the wings of the Shechinah," and elevating the sparks of G-dliness found in these places. This fulfills G-d's intention to have "a dwelling place in the lower worlds."

Furthermore, by involving himself in the service of drawing others back to their Jewish heritage, a person can reach a higher level himself. Pirkei Avos 4:1 teaches: "Who is the wise man? One who learns from every man." For a person to attain true wisdom, he must seek contact and learn from every man.

To put the above in simple terms: One must go out to the street and meet a Jew who knows nothing about Judaism and influence him to increase his Jewish practice, and, as a first start, establish fixed times for Torah study. A person must be willing to go beyond his nature and familiar pattern and dedicate himself to spreading Judaism with even greater energy and vigor. This service will bring about abundant blessing including the most complete blessing, the coming of the Messianic redemption. May it be speedily in our days.

2. After all the above, a Jew might raise his hands in confusion. There are so many things that are necessary for him to do that he does not know where to start. Indeed, for that reason, he remains complacent and does nothing at all.

Firstly, he must realize that this lack of knowledge is his own fault. On Devorim 32:47: "It (Torah) is not an empty thing from you," our Sages commented: "The Torah is not an empty thing. If you see it as empty, realize that this emptiness comes 'from you.'"

In practice, such a person should approach a wise man and ask him for advice. Every Jew has a Rav whom he consults about questions of Kashrus. If he asks a Rav what to do when he used a milchik spoon to stir a fleishik pot, he should be willing to consult the Rav on something as important as his priorities in the service of G-d.

The above applies to every Jew, for every Jew can be a Mashpia. Just as in a material sense, every Jew is obligated to give charity, similarly, in a spiritual sense, every Jew must be charitable and share his insights and knowledge with others.

To conclude with a positive point: Every Jew must "go out from his land, his homeland, and father's house" and apply himself to fulfilling G-d's mission of spreading Torah and mitzvos. This will cause G-d to take us "to the land I will show you," to Eretz Yisroel, with the coming of the Messianic redemption. May it come with happiness, speedily in our days.
