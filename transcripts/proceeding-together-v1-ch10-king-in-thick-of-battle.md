# The King in the Thick of Battle

The Rebbe Rayatz explained that the drive for victory is rooted in the soul's deepest core, transcending conscious faculties. This attribute is so profound that to achieve victory in battle, even "secret treasures, locked away for generations, are squandered." A king will personally enter battle and risk his life for victory.

## Application to the Current Era

The Rebbe applies this to the final period before Redemption, when spiritual service requires a mode of victory with "unquestioning acceptance of the yoke of heaven." The Rebbe Rayatz revealed hidden teachings -- accumulated since the Baal Shem Tov's time -- for this purpose, yet people did not fully embrace them. Therefore, the Rebbe Rayatz himself "took up his position in the thick of battle," engaging in mundane affairs alongside lofty spiritual pursuits.

## Conclusion

Since the Rebbe Rayatz's writings end at this point, stating the king risks his life, the discourse concludes that this represents sufficient spiritual determination. The community must "muster strength and courage to secure victory," confident the Rebbe will lead them to greet Mashiach.
