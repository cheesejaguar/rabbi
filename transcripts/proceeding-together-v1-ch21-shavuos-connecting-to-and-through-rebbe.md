## 1. Humility Is Not Worthlessness

The Rebbe Rayatz clarifies that humility and joy are not contradictory but rather reinforce each other. A humble person possesses strength in convictions because their lowliness does not stem from actual weakness. Rather, the humble individual recognizes their own qualities and worth, yet understands the deeper truth: "whatever is positive within himself is not of his own doing, but has reached him as a heritage from our forefathers." This self-effacement creates the conditions for elevated joy.

## 2. Mortal Initiative: A Divine Gift

Before Sinai, all divine revelations resulted from heavenly initiative. Even the Patriarchs, though observing Torah's commandments, did so spiritually -- they did not draw holiness into material objects themselves.

At Matan Torah, a new possibility emerged: upward elevation initiated by humans below. This human initiative becomes possible not through inherent worth but through "the heavenly Partner (by way of a gift or bequest), Whose Will it is." This realization embodies true humility.

## 3. Delaying the Redemption

One must recognize that all qualities and strengths come from the Rebbe alone. This knowledge should inspire absolute self-effacement to fulfill the Rebbe's mission.

A chassid wrote about being brokenhearted since the Rebbe's passing, sometimes weeping alone. However, "What did he accomplish by his weeping?" The work of fulfilling the mission given by the Rebbe is not being done!

"What are people waiting for? The Redemption is being held up! It's already past noon on erev Shabbos!"

## 4. Acting with Certainty

The Second Day of Shavuos in the Diaspora is a Yom Tov with certainty, not arising from doubt. The numerical equivalent of "safek" (doubt) equals "Amalek." Amalek's role is cooling holy enthusiasm and raising doubts. This force must be annulled so that one engages in kedushah with determined vigor springing from certainty.

## 5. Degrees of Authoritativeness

The same principle applies to directives from the Rebbe. Just as rabbinic ordinances enjoy identical sanctity as Torah-prescribed law, so too does a Rebbe's directive enjoy the same authority as a Torah-commanded obligation.

## 6. A Rare Opportunity

The Rebbe Rayatz wrote describing Shavuos as a time of Divine favor. G-d confuses the Prosecuting Angel. Since the Rebbe Rayatz likens Shavuos to both Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, on Shavuos G-d confuses the Prosecuting Angel to such a degree that he does not exist.

## 7. The Rebbe Before Our Eyes

When studying the Rebbe's teachings, one should follow the Sages' directive that "Whoever cites a teaching in the name of its author should visualize that mentor standing before him."

The Tzemach Tzedek once asked chassidim to sing the Alter Rebbe's Niggun of Four Themes. As he sang, all present found themselves searching the room for the Alter Rebbe.

Similarly, when studying a maamar, sichah, or letter from the Rebbe Rayatz, one should meditate and recall the Rebbe's appearance as if standing before them.

## 8. The Rebbe Is Distilled In His Teachings

The author of Meor Einayim, citing the Baal Shem Tov, writes: "A tzaddik lies buried in his teachings, and in them his entire vital essence lies hidden. Hence, when a disciple studies those teachings, spirit cleaves to spirit."

This teaching particularly addresses those unable to visit the Rebbe's holy resting place. Studying his teachings is akin to prostrating oneself at his grave.

Since the Rebbe invested his very essence in his teachings, studying them generates a bond with him.

## 9. Connected To the Rebbe and Through the Rebbe

One cultivates a bond with the Rebbe not because of particular qualities but because he is a Rebbe.

The Rashbatz was once asked whether the Rebbe Rashab possessed divine inspiration through ruach hakodesh. He replied: "What does ruach hakodesh matter to me? I know that he's a Rebbe. So if a Rebbe needs ruach hakodesh, then of course he's got it."

A Rebbe is someone connected with the Infinite One's very Essence and Being. Therefore, one should concern themselves only with being connected to the Rebbe, and through the Rebbe becoming connected with the Infinite One's Essence and Being.

A recent chassid excitedly told the Rebbe that the Rebbe Rayatz once said to him: "Be bound to me, and through me you will be bound to Him to Whom I am bound."

## 15-18. Tractate Sotah and Humility

At Tractate Sotah's conclusion: "With the passing of Rebbe [Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi], humility and fear of sin ceased." Rav Yosef told the tanna: "Do not say that humility has ceased, for there is [still] me." Rav Nachman told the tanna: "Do not say that fear of sin has ceased, for there is [still] me."

Because Rav Yosef's humility made him realize all his qualities were granted from above, he regarded them as belonging to Rebbe. When he said "there is still me," he proved that in truth Rebbe had not died.

True humility -- awareness of one's qualities combined with utter self-effacement from realizing one's qualities are not one's own -- is possible only by virtue of the Rebbe.

## 21. An End to Exile

May G-d grant that my revered father-in-law, the Rebbe Rayatz, come, garbed in a body, and take us out of exile!

May he be garbed once more in a body, and come (it doesn't matter how, whether through the door or the window or the roof), and gather together all the Children of Israel, and proclaim, "The time has come to leave galus! Let us go to our Holy Land!"
