1. Although the event for which we are gathered together is celebrated every year, this year it must be celebrated with a totally new enthusiasm. Parallels to this may be found in halachah: Although a Jew may perform the same mitzvos from time to time or even every day, Torah instructs that "every day they should be new in your eyes."

The mitzvah of tzedakah, which is equal to all the mitzvos and hastens the redemption, is an example. When a Jew performs this mitzvah for the very first time, he does so with the greatest of enthusiasm and excitement knowing that G-d has chosen him as His agent to feed the poor person and his family. Torah's directive, "Every day they should be new in your eyes," means that although a Jew may have performed the mitzvah of tzedakah many times, every day before praying, he must do so again today with the same enthusiasm and excitement as the first time.

But, one may ask, why should one be required to fulfill a mitzvah with the same enthusiasm as the first time? It is not a new mitzvah: It was commanded in the past, and he has fulfilled it many times in the past.

Categories such as "old" and "young" do not apply to G-d, however. As even the simplest Jew knows, it is absurd to talk of G-d as being young, or middle-aged, or old. So also concerning G-d's commandments: We cannot say that when G-d first commanded the mitzvos He did so amidst lightning and voices and atop a smoking mountain, and the following year the commandments are "old." For just as time is a concept inapplicable to G-d, so G-d's commandments are immune to changes wrought by time. G-d commands the mitzvos every day anew, just as at the time of the Giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai. Therefore, "Every day they shall be new in your eyes as though on that very day you were commanded regarding them."

Upon awakening in the morning a Jew says, "I offer thanks to You, living and eternal King, for You have mercifully restored my soul within me." In other words, every day a person is a new creation. Physically, every day he needs to eat and drink to keep himself alive, although he had satisfied his physical needs yesterday and in the preceding days and years. For when a person is truly ravenous and thirsty, he is burningly impatient to still his hunger and quench his thirst. It makes no difference that eating and drinking are "old" things, done for many years. He is as eager to eat and drink now as the first time he realized that food stills hunger and drink quenches thirst!

If the above applies to a person's bodily life, it certainly applies to one's spiritual life, to one's soul: One must be burningly impatient and eager to fulfill Torah and mitzvos, although one has fulfilled them in the past.

2. The above serves as the introduction to the farbrengen; then comes the "opening" -- in the words of our Sages, "Open with a blessing." And indeed, it is the custom when two Jews meet to open with the blessing, "Shalom Aleichem" -- "Peace unto you," for peace encompasses all blessings.

When opening with a blessing, preference is given to the blessing found in Scripture (Tehillim 118:26): "Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the L-rd; we bless you from the House of the L-rd." This verse begins with singular tense ("Blessed is he who comes") and concludes with plural tense ("We bless you" -- the plural "you" in Hebrew).

A person "who comes" to join a community may think that he thereby loses his identity as a unique individual. This verse teaches otherwise: "Blessed is he who comes" -- although an individual is in the presence of a community, he not only retains his identity ("he") but a special blessing is bestowed upon him ("Blessed is he").

A similar concept is expressed by our Sages' saying (Sanhedrin 37a), "Man was created single to teach you that ... he is a complete world." Every living being created in the six days of creation was created as a pair, male and female. Man alone was created single to teach every person in every generation that he is a "complete world," similar to Adam the first man.

When a person sees how dwarfed he is by the inexplicable variety and number of creations in the world, of the inanimate, plant, animal and human kingdoms, he may become despondent thinking, "What am I? What is my life?" The creation of man alone teaches that each person is a "complete world," replete with everything necessary to make the world a decent, productive place.

When, therefore, an individual comes to a community, his identity is not lost: he is a "complete world." Moreover, a special blessing is bestowed upon him ("Blessed is he who comes"), meaning that when he does his utmost, he not only sees success in his work but he sees a blessing in it.

The conclusion of the verse is, "We bless you" -- "you," plural tense. When an individual joins the community, he also assumes the qualities, merits and blessings pertaining to a community.

3. All of the above has a special connection with the 12th-13th of Tammuz, the days when the previous Rebbe was liberated from imprisonment in Soviet Russia. These days show that not only is it possible to engage in Torah study and observance of mitzvos in such a country, but also that one can send an envoy ("shaliach") whose appearance testifies to his Jewish identity (beard and "peyos") to a remote place in that country to there found a "cheder" (school) in which children should learn the aleph-bais.

We are assured that efforts in such a direction will be in the manner of "liberation" -- i.e., those envoys will eventually defeat the "darkness which covers the earth" in that country. As indeed we see the fruits of the work of the previous Rebbe's envoys -- children and children's children in all parts of the world observant of Torah and mitzvos.

It follows that the theme of the 12th-13th of Tammuz is that personal service in Torah study and observance of mitzvos is insufficient, but one must also disseminate Torah and Judaism everywhere, even in the most remote places -- even if it is very difficult, even if self-sacrifice is needed. In the words of mishnah (Pirkei Avos 1:1), "Raise up many disciples." It is not enough to personally receive the Torah and its dictates; one should follow Moshe Rabbeinu's example, who "received the Torah from Sinai and passed it on" to all generations, together with the directive "Raise up many disciples."

In the words of the previous Rebbe concerning his liberation on the 12th-13th of Tammuz: "G-d did not redeem only me on the 12th of Tammuz, but also all those who hold our holy Torah dear, observers of mitzvos, and also those who are a Jew only in name." All Jews, including those Jewish only in name, were liberated at the same time as the previous Rebbe, in the same liberation.

4. It is therefore imperative that the youth be instilled with belief in G-d, through the public school system which is responsible for the proper education of the country's children.

The only way to correct the present situation is to institute a "moment of silence" in every public school. At the beginning of the school day, before studies begin, while the student is still fresh, a "moment of silence" should be devoted to thinking about the Creator and Ruler of the world. Starting the school-day in such a fashion will have a beneficial effect on the rest of the day's conduct, teaching a student to utilize his studies for worthy purposes, justice and righteousness, both on his own behalf and that of the public.

It is important to stress that this should be a "moment of silence," not spoken prayer. A "moment of silence," in contrast, has the advantage that nothing will be spoken; only thought is involved. Each student will think about what his parents and grandparents tell him, avoiding any friction in the school; no one will know what the other is thinking.

By instituting a "moment of silence" in school, causing children to ask their parents what they should think about during that moment, parents will be reminded and inspired about their principal function to raise "a blessed generation of the upright" and will therefore dedicate time to their children's upbringing. As a result, the parents themselves will be drawn closer to Judaism. In the words of Scripture (Malachi 3:24): "He shall return the heart of the fathers through the sons."

5. The beginning of today's section of the weekly parshah states (Bamidbar 28:2-4): "My offering, My food offering consumed by fire ... two yearly male lambs without blemish, every day, as a daily burnt-offering. You shall offer one lamb in the morning, and the other lamb toward evening."

This section speaks of sacrifices, particularly the daily offering, which, as a "burnt-offering," was offered totally to G-d. Our Sages say (Berachos 26b), "The prayers were instituted corresponding to the daily offerings." "Sacrifice," in Hebrew "korban," is cognate to the root "kiruv," "nearness" -- meaning a sacrifice draws man near to G-d. Prayer, besides being the requesting of man's needs from G-d, is the medium through which man draws near to G-d.

That the daily sacrifice was a burnt-offering, all of it to G-d, also has meaning in its parallel to prayer. One is truly near to G-d only when his service is performed "without the intent of receiving a reward," solely to draw near to Him. True nearness to G-d is when the person does not consider the benefits he will gain by observing Torah and mitzvos, but he simply wants to be close to G-d as an end in itself.

The verse says, "You shall offer one lamb in the morning, and the other lamb toward evening." A Jew may think that the spiritual equivalent of the burnt-offering, drawing near to G-d without ulterior motive, is possible only "in the morning" -- "morning" referring to a situation that is full of "light." That is, when his spiritual situation is satisfactory and his material position is also good.

When, however, a Jew is in a situation of "toward evening" -- meaning he considers his spiritual and material position to be gloomy -- he may think that he cannot possibly pray to G-d without any ulterior motives.

That the daily sacrifice was offered twice a day -- once in the morning and once toward the evening, teaches that its spiritual equivalent must be a constant service, in every situation -- in a position of "darkness" as well as in "light."

When a Jew does act in the proper manner, he thereby merits G-d's blessings for all things, and hastens the true and complete redemption through our righteous Mashiach.

6. Now is the time to talk about the previous Rebbe's enactment which he directed should be publicized until it is accepted the world over. He instructed that all Jews should learn Chitas -- Chumash, Tehillim, and Tanya.

Chumash: To each day learn that day's section of the weekly parshah as it is apportioned among the days of the week.

Tehillim: To each day recite the day's portion of Tehillim as it is apportioned among the days of the month.

Tanya: To each day learn the day's portion of Tanya as it is apportioned among the days of the month.

This includes all the mitzvah campaigns: Love and unity between Jews; education of oneself and others; Torah; tefillin; mezuzah; tzedakah; to possess Jewish books; Shabbos and Yom Tov candles; kashrus; family purity; a letter for each Jew in one of the general Sifrei Torah; the study of Rambam; and the printing of Tanya in every place.
