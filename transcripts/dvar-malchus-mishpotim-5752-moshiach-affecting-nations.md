On Erev Shabbos Mishpatim, 5752 (January 31, 1992), world leaders announced weapons reduction decisions. The Rebbe describes this as establishing a "new epoch in international relations -- eliminating a state of wars between the countries of the world, illustrated by the reduction and destruction of weaponry."

## Messianic Prophecy Fulfilled

The article references messianic prophecies: "They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore," noting this occurs "through the actions of Melech Hamoshiach himself."

The Rebbe identifies these geopolitical developments as "a clear sign of the beginning of the fulfillment of this promise in the true and complete Geulah via Moshiach Tzidkeinu."

## Historical Connection

The article emphasizes the connection between the Previous Rebbe and United Nations establishment in New York, noting 770 First Avenue's historical significance.

## Key Statement

The Rebbe presents a profound connection: "The decision and announcement by leaders of the nations of the world about the state of beating swords into plowshares, is a result of the decision and announcement of the kings, the Rabbis that behold this one comes."

## Conclusion

Halachic rulings regarding Moshiach create spiritual reality affecting worldly dimensions, causing nations to independently adopt messianic-era policies.
