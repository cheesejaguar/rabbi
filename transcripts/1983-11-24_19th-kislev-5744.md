---

This discourse commemorates the Alter Rebbe's liberation from Czarist imprisonment and draws connections between this historical event and the holiday of Chanukah, exploring themes of revealing mystical Torah teachings to the wider world.

## The Paradox of Tradition and Renewal

The Rebbe emphasizes that Torah maintains both constancy and perpetual freshness: "This Torah shall never be changed" coexists with the requirement that observances be experienced "as new in your eyes" each year.

## Oil as Symbol

Oil represents the innermost mysteries of Torah. Chanukah's miracle involved oil that "provided light, to shine forth to the outside," symbolizing revelation of esoteric knowledge beyond elite circles.

## ChaBaD Approach

The Alter Rebbe innovated by making Chassidic (mystical) teachings intellectually comprehensible through Chochmah (Wisdom), Binah (Understanding), and Daat (Knowledge) -- forming the "ChaBaD" methodology that allows hidden teachings to penetrate one's "entire existence."

## Practical Applications

The discourse emphasizes that spiritual understanding should influence mundane affairs. Jews should conduct business with integrity transcending legal minimums and work toward convincing non-Jews to observe the Seven Noachide Laws establishing societal stability.

## Education Legacy

The Alter Rebbe distinguished himself through combining theoretical teaching with practical example, famously interrupting Yom Kippur prayers to assist a woman in need -- demonstrating that spiritual engagement never exempts one from concrete human service.
